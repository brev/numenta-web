AGPL\n                is a “copyleft” license. It requires that if you distribute or\n                make available your software (either directly or through a\n                SaaS model), you must also distribute the source code under\n                the AGPL license. For some companies and some situations, that\n                is an acceptable requirement. However, companies who want to\n                keep the resulting code proprietary will prefer a commercial\n                license.\n              </DefineItem>\n              <DefineTitle>\n                If I do not intend to distribute or make available as a SaaS\n                implementation any derivative software, then it seems to me\n                that I can use the AGPL version internally without any\n                additional license, even if it is for a commercial purpose.\n                For example, I run a hedge fund and I figured out how to use\n                NuPIC to advantage, but I don’t distribute the software or\n                results, nor do I make it available to others. Is this\n                correct?\n              </DefineTitle>\n              <DefineItem>\n                Generally you may use the software and patents for internal\n                use under the AGPL. Note, however, if you do not use our\n                open-source software (and thus do not fall under the AGPL),\n                you WOULD need a license for our IP. For example, say you do\n                your own, very specific version of HTM for your hedge fund.\n                Once you deploy that within your company for any productive\n                purpose (as opposed to research), you would need an IP license\n                from us because you are not under the AGPL.\n              </DefineItem>\n              <DefineTitle>\n                I’m a researcher who uses different machine learning\n                techniques.

We believe the brain is the best example of an\n            intelligent system, providing a roadmap for building intelligent\n            machines. The brain’s center of intelligence, the neocortex,\n            controls a wide range of functions using a common set of\n            principles. We have made significant progress discovering these\n            principles and using them to create the Hierarchical Temporal\n            Memory (HTM) learning algorithms.\n          </Paragraph>\n          <Paragraph>\n            Because today’s computers are programmed, they can only do\n            exactly as they are told. In stark contrast, intelligent\n            machines continuously and automatically learn patterns in their\n            environment without being programmed, enabling them to tackle\n            problems in entirely new ways. Intelligent machines that learn\n            and act will have an enormous beneficial impact in the coming\n            decades.\n          </Paragraph>\n          <Paragraph>\n            We have made significant progress in understanding the neocortex\n            and building software based on those principles.

Berkeley titled, <a href=\\\"http://lyra.berkeley.edu/CDIConf/\\\">“From Data to\\nKnowledge: Machine-Learning with Real-time and Streaming\\nApplications.”</a></p>\\n<p>This was a remarkable workshop, not just because of who presented or its\\nlocation, but simply because it was a workshop on streaming analytics.  Today we\\nhear so much about “big data” and the database tools you can use to sort through\\nlarge amounts of data.  However at Numenta we see a different future.  The\\nfuture we see is one with billions of data sources streaming data.  Every\\nbuilding, server, machine, and windmill will be equipped with multiple sensors.\\nData from these sensors will flow directly to predictive models, which will make\\npredictions and detect anomalies.  Through these models we will take immediate\\naction.  This future is about billions of data streams flowing to hundreds of\\nmillions of predictive models, not petabytes of data sitting in hard drives to\\nbe looked at later, hence Streams and Lakes.</p>\\n<p>This isn’t an either or situation.  There is plenty of opportunity mining big\\ndata repositories, but we believe the growth will occur mostly in the\\nproliferation of data sources and the ability to act on data as soon as it is\\ncreated.  For example, imagine a building adjusting its energy consumption\\nminute-by-minute based on predictions of price and demand several hours in the\\nfuture.  If the price of electricity is predicted to go up later in the day, the\\nbuilding lowers its temperature now and so it can turn off the cooling later,\\nsaving money.  Today we may do this for a campus or building, tomorrow your\\nrefrigerator will do the same.</p>\\n<p>Predictive models for streaming data are fundamentally different than models\\nused on stored data.</p>\\n<p>In my talk at the Berkeley workshop, titled “Modeling Data Streams Using Sparse\\nDistributed Representations,” I focused on two essential and unique attributes\\nof streaming models.  First, they must be “online.”  This means that the models\\nhave to learn with each new record.  Online models automatically adjust, record\\nby record, as the patterns in the data change.  Second, streaming models also\\nmust be “variable order” temporal models.  To make good predictions, a model\\nmight need to take into account what happened two steps ago, four steps ago, or\\nten steps ago.  Patterns over time, like a melody, are usually more important\\nthan what is happening now.</p>\\n<p>At the heart of our product Grok is a novel learning algorithm that is\\ninherently online and variable order.  This isn’t surprising because it models a\\nslice of the neocortex, which is also online and variable order.  Although much\\nof the detail in how these algorithms work is explained in the\\n<a href=\\\"http://numenta.org/cla-white-paper.html\\\">white paper</a> on our website, my\\n25-minute talk at Berkeley covered the essentials, yet is simpler and easier to\\nunderstand.

In this blog entry, I will focus on one specific\\ndifference, perhaps the most fundamental one.</p>\\n<p>First a bit of background: There is a well known truism in machine learning, the\\n&quot;No Free Lunch Theorem,&quot; which states that no algorithm is inherently better\\nthan any other algorithm. What distinguishes one algorithm from the next are the\\ninherent assumptions and how well those assumptions fit the problem domain. For\\nexample, if you are predicting data that lies on a straight line, nothing is\\ngoing to beat linear fitting. If the data lies on a circle, it’s hard to imagine\\na worse technique.</p>\\n<p>By far the most common assumption made in machine learning is the &quot;i.i.d&quot;\\nassumption. In statistics, i.i.d. stands for\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables\\\">independently and identically distributed</a>,\\nwhich states that every input record comes from the same probability\\ndistribution and is statistically independent of previous and future records.\\nThis is a very useful assumption - it makes the math easier, leads to\\nthe Central Limit Theorem, allows you to derive accuracy bounds, etc. Just about\\nevery popular technique, such as regression, support vector machines, neural\\nnetworks, Bayesian networks, random forests, and decision trees rely on this\\nassumption.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, when you think about the real world of streaming data, this\\nassumption is just plain wrong. Your weekly revenue numbers are not i.i.d. Last\\nweek’s numbers are a better predictor than the numbers from 13 weeks ago.\\nYesterday’s weather is correlated with today’s. The web log for a customer\\nnavigating an e-commerce website is likely to follow specific sequences. Your\\nGPS coordinates from 5 minutes ago are an excellent predictor of your current\\nlocation. The list is endless. Streaming temporal patterns are the very\\nantithesis of i.i.d.</p>\\n<p>The CLA is an inherently temporal learning algorithm, and doesn’t care about\\ni.i.d. It greedily constructs sequences and does not assume independence. If you\\nsaw a particular revenue pattern the last two weeks, it assumes you are more\\nlikely to see it this week. If you haven’t seen a pattern for several years, it\\nwill likely forget it. Also, CLA assumes that the underlying distribution can\\nchange. This is what makes it online or adaptive. If your revenue jumps because\\nyou just added an important customer, it will adapt. It inherently assumes your\\ndata stream contains sequences and is constantly changing. We didn’t invent this</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>the core ideas are inherent in the neocortex of the brain and lend themselves\\nwell to streaming data analytics.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>CLA is not the only technique to break the i.i.d. assumption. Other algorithms,\\nsuch as Hidden Markov Models and many time series algorithms, also relax that\\nassumption. So, how is CLA different from HMMs? Good question. I guess we’ll\\njust have to tackle that in another blog entry…stay tuned!</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/06/04/how-is-groks-algorithm-different.md\n ** module id = 734\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"fdb1a30b918e2fc84ddccde8b4e81222.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/06/04/images/image.png\n ** module id = 735\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"8eab4399bfe964a2be071a866c75a99e.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/06/04/images/image@2x.png\n ** module id = 736\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"b78ed447b770f0be762ef864b9cb555f.jpg\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/06/04/images/main.jpg\n ** module id = 737\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"e66bf22834bbedb5970a201fbd8cb179.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/08/27/images/image.png\n ** module id = 738\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"d9551d4bfed9a47c36bfa0daf30d2b98.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/08/27/images/image@2x.png\n ** module id = 739\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"91ae5e1e3392685456de00f2a1c82453.jpg\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/08/27/images/main.jpg\n ** module id = 740\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Rob Haitani\",\"brief\":\"Years ago, a retiring artificial intelligence researcher told Jeff Hawkins that \\\"one of biggest problems in AI--no, the only problem in AI--is the problem of representation.\\\" If the meaning of that statement isn't intuitively obvious\",\"date\":\"2012/08/27\",\"featured\":false,\"image\":\"../images/image.png\",\"org\":\"Marketing\",\"title\":\"The Problem of Representation\",\"tags\":\"Neuroscience, Machine Learning\",\"type\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Years ago, a retiring artificial intelligence researcher told Jeff Hawkins that\\n&quot;one of biggest problems in AI–no, the only problem in AI–is the problem of\\nrepresentation.&quot;  If the meaning of that statement isn’t intuitively obvious to\\nyou, don’t worry.

This isn’t the first time\\nsomeone has noticed that SDRs and Bloom filters use similar data structures, so\\nwe’d like to describe the significant differences in their implementation and\\ncapabilities.</p>\\n<p>Bloom filters are a fast and memory-efficient way to tell if you’ve seen\\nsomething before. They can tell you with 100% confidence that something is new,\\nthough they can’t tell you for sure if an input has been seen before. (See this\\n<a href=\\\"http://billmill.org/bloomfilter-tutorial/\\\">excellent visualization by Bill Mill</a>).</p>\\n<p>SDRs, core to Numenta’s Cortical Learning Algorithm, are the way we represent\\nand recognize inputs in a system like Grok:</p>\\n<p>&quot;The concept of SDRs comes from neuroscience, where sometimes it is called\\n&quot;sparse coding. SDRs are the language of brains in the same way that bytes and\\n&quot;words are the language of digital computers.  Sparse distributed\\n&quot;representations have several desirable properties including high capacity,\\n&quot;graceful degradation, tolerance to errors, and the ability to simultaneously\\n&quot;represent multiple values in one representation.</p>\\n<p>Both Bloom filters and SDRs store information in data structures called bit\\narrays (or vectors), long strings where each character is either a one or a\\nzero. When encountering a new input, both create a representation of that input\\nby selecting a set of those bits to set as ones, or as we say “turn on.” Because\\nboth choose a small subset of the bits to turn on, these representations can\\nboth be considered “sparse.” Both, depending on the size of the array, have a\\nhigh capacity to store many inputs, and both can represent multiple inputs\\nsimultaneously.</p>\\n<p>We need a bit more detail about Bloom filters to understand how they differ\\nfundamentally from SDRs.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/bloom-thumb.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Bloom Filter\\\" title=\\\"Bloom filter image\\\"></p>\\n<p>(Click image to enlarge.)</p>\\n<p>To create a Bloom filter, you select one or more hashes. These are functions\\nthat take an input and select which small set of bits to turn on in the bit\\narray.</p>\\n<p>Three key properties determine the efficient and predictable nature of Bloom\\nfilters. Take, for example, a Bloom filter with three inputs: “Monday”,\\n“Thursday”, “Friday.” In a Bloom filter, the output bits representing these\\ninputs are uniformly distributed across the bit array.  The representation of\\nthese outputs are independent of any similarities from the inputs.  And each\\ninput always maps to the same output representations.</p>\\n<p>SDRs, on the other hand, assume the exact opposite!</p>\\n<p>Modeled after the brain, SDRs care about <em>semantic</em> relationships. We care that\\ninputs with similar meanings are stored in similar ways.  Because Thursday is\\nmuch closer to Friday than it is to Monday, SDR representations of the inputs\\n&quot;Thursday&quot; and “Friday” are similar!</p>\\n<p>Semantic relationships allow an SDR to answer not only the question, “Have you\\never seen this?” but also the question “Have you ever seen something <em>like</em>\\nthis?”   Today we store inputs in a bit array that is 2000 bits long. Each new\\ninput turns on 40 of those bits. If two inputs are very similar they may share a\\ngood number of bits that get turned on (violating the independence assumption of\\nBloom filters) and if they are very different they will almost certainly have a\\nvery different set.</p>\\n<p>Going back to our example, let’s show a Bloom filter and an SDR the input\\n&quot;Saturday.&quot; If “Saturday” contains a single bit that is not on in the filter,\\nthe Bloom filter confidently tells us it has never seen that before. An SDR, on\\nthe other hand, would say, “Wait a minute, I’ve seen something close to that,\\nhow about “Friday”?” An SDR is <em>robust</em> to some variations in input and is able\\nto <em>generalize</em> based on semantic closeness of inputs to previously seen values.\\nThese properties are crucial in allowing Grok to correctly identify the same\\nobject in different circumstances.</p>\\n<p>Similar inputs get blended, or, as we say, “pooled” together. When we retrieve\\nvalues from our data structure even a small overlap on the input will generate\\nsome output. You could say our false positive rate is much higher than a Bloom\\nfilter. However, overlapping inputs allow us to group similar things together.\\nAlso because SDRs produce output when there are partial matches, they are\\ntolerant of noise. We can recognize two similar inputs even if they are\\nobscured, just like a human can recognize a loved-one’s face even through the\\nbranches of a tree, or a familiar voice in a noisy room.</p>\\n<p>A false positive for a Bloom filter, in contrast, doesn’t mean anything. It’s\\ngoverned by chance, not semantic closeness. Bloom filters  throw away\\nsimilarities in inputs, whereas  SDRs take advantage of them.</p>\\n<p>SDRs also differ by having dynamic representations. They change over time. The\\nsame input doesn’t always map to the same representation. When learning new\\nthings, which representation you end up with in the SDR depends on what the\\nsystem has seen before. In addition if you haven’t seen an input for a while its\\nrepresentation may have degraded somewhat. Because SDRs retain representations\\nstrongly that are regularly reinforced and forget ones that are not, SDRs learn\\nand retain the most important inputs without getting “filled up” by noise. A\\nBloom filter is static and will continue to get filled up for as long as it\\ncontinues to see new inputs. But then again, a Bloom filter that &quot;forgot&quot;\\nwouldn’t be very useful.</p>\\n<p>As you can see,  combining values and storing them in a bit array is a powerful\\nidea. You can end up with a memory-efficient test like the Bloom filter, or a\\nlearning system that is general purpose, robust, adaptive, and high capacity\\nlike SDRs.  There’s actually much more to SDRs. I’ve only described the use of\\nSDRs in a component of our system called the Spatial Pooler. There’s a whole\\nother set of representations in our Temporal Pooler that we don’t have time to\\ngo into here.</p>\\n<p>You can find more information on SDRs, their properties and how they relate to\\nthe brain, in <a href=\\\"http://youtu.be/A8sHMcCk0lU\\\">another recent keynote</a> by Jeff\\nHawkins.</p>\\n<p>For more information on Bloom filters,\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter\\\">the wikipedia article</a> is\\n<em>reasonably</em> accessible.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/10/07/wait-the-brain-is-a-bloom-filter.md\n ** module id = 751\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"de4206d5b52744cd21648b51361ef1fc.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/10/22/images/image.png\n ** module id = 752\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"0a5ff26d7d46fd446766626b56697fd5.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/10/22/images/image@2x.png\n ** module id = 753\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"5ba98f4b599be4ad624c981c03ce337d.jpg\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/10/22/images/main.jpg\n ** module id = 754\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Rob Haitani\",\"brief\":\"Jeff Hawkins recently gave a keynote address at Strange Loop 2012, a conference on diverse topics like emerging languages, alternative databases, concurrency and distributed systems.\",\"date\":\"2012/10/22\",\"featured\":false,\"image\":\"../images/image.png\",\"org\":\"Marketing\",\"tags\":\"Neuroscience, Machine Learning\",\"title\":\"Jeff Hawkins at Strange Loop\",\"type\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Jeff Hawkins recently gave a keynote address at\\n<a href=\\\"https://thestrangeloop.com/\\\">Strange Loop 2012</a>, a multi-disciplinary\\nconference on diverse\\ntopics like emerging languages, alternative databases, concurrency and\\ndistributed systems.</p>\\n<p>This talk was similar to the keynote speech Jeff gave at the recent\\n<a href=\\\"http://isca2012.ittc.ku.edu/\\\">ISCA Conference</a>, providing a good overview of\\nthe neuroscience and technology behind Grok (e.g.,sparse distributed\\nrepresentations and sequence memory). In this version, Jeff shows an example of\\nhow Grok adapts to unexpected change when predicting energy consumption in a\\nbuilding. At first, Grok learns a weekly pattern: energy usage climbs during the\\nday, but drops at night and on weekends, when the building is closed. One week,\\nhowever, Thursday and Friday are holidays, so the building is closed. Grok\\npredicts that energy will rise on Thursday morning, only to see that its\\npredictions are inaccurate, because energy consumption remains flat in the empty\\nbuilding. Instead of blindly forging ahead with the rest of the regular Thursday\\npattern, however, Grok adapts automatically and shifts its forecast to predict\\nflat levels.  Grok was not trained with data for holidays, but it recognizes\\nthat the pattern has changed and adapts accordingly.</p>\\n<p>Jeff also spends a little more time talking about the future of the technology,\\nincluding the somewhat contrarian opinion that “The goal here is not to build\\n…human-like things, it’s not to pass the Turing Test.

Or robotic butlers and immortal carriers of our memories?  Berkeley\\nrecently uploaded a <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/user/numenta\\\">video</a> of a talk by\\nJeff Hawkins that concludes with his thoughts about the future of intelligent\\nmachines.</p>\\n<p>Most people assume that intelligent machines will be like humans. Instead, Jeff\\nstarts by defining what intelligence is, then removing humans from the equation\\nand asking what would happen if we applied these principles.  This doesn’t\\nnecessarily lead us to C3PO.</p>\\n<p>In the Berkeley lecture, Jeff states his opinions on whether or not certain\\ntechnical advances will happen.   First, it seems inevitable that intelligent\\nmachines will reap the benefits of removing biological constraints.  Our brains\\nare very slow, and limited in capacity due to the size of the birth canal\\n(“Nature might want to make bigger brains, but they don’t come out,” Jeff\\njokes.)  Intelligent machines will be millions of times faster and with much\\nlarger memory capacity than human brains.  In addition, these machines will not\\nbe limited by human senses.  “Everything a human has to understand we have to\\nput into something that runs at our speed and through our senses.”  Imagine\\nfeeding into intelligent machines input from huge arrays of distributed sensors,\\nor nano-sensors, or higher-dimensional sensors.  “If I had sensors that really\\ncould live in that world, they could think in that world.”</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, Jeff is skeptical that you will ever be able to upload your\\nbrain to a machine and live forever.  And even if you could, it would be “a very\\nunsatisfactory experience,” at least from the mortal biological perspective\\n(i.e., yours).  It would probably be more like the Twilight Zone episode where\\nyou are replaced by an exact duplicate.</p>\\n<p>Jeff also doesn’t believe that evil robots will emerge, at least not as an\\nunintended byproduct. There are simply too many obstacles to overcome even if\\nevil robots were your intended output.  But he doesn’t kid himself into thinking\\nthat intelligent machines will only be used for benign purposes. Any powerful\\ntechnology can be used for malevolent purposes.</p>\\n<p>In closing, Jeff argues that intelligent machines will be “essential for the\\nsurvival of our species, and…our mission as a species.”  Not only will\\nintelligent machines provide net benefits to the world in the same way that\\ncomputers have, but they will also enable us to discover more about the\\nuniverse. For example, Jeff doubts humans will ever explore deep space, but\\nintelligent machines could.  The Bradbury fan in me hopes this is not true.  But\\nthe point is that even if we did figure out how to send humans into deep space,\\nit will always be easier and cheaper to send our machines.</p>\\n<p>Ultimately it boils down to the fact that “we want to know more about things,”\\nand  “today our brains are how we figure out more.”   Therefore, it’s logical to\\nconclude that an exponential expansion of (machine) intelligence will lead to an\\nexponential expansion in knowledge.  That’s a long way in the future, but here\\nat Numenta we’re passionate about setting humanity on that path.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2012/12/13/jeff-hawkins-on-skynet-vs-c3po.md\n ** module id = 759\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Rob Haitani\",\"brief\":\"We modeled Grok after the human brain because the brain is a predictive modeling system.

This is the first post in a series describing what this\\nmeans: how the brain works, and how this benefits Grok.  The content is based on\\nlectures given by Jeff Hawkins describing his detailed, biologically accurate\\nmodel of a layer of cells in the neocortex, called the Cortical Learning\\nAlgorithm (CLA).</p>\\n<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the brain does not compute.  Neural activity bears\\nlittle resemblance to how computers (or neural networks, for that matter)\\noperate.  For example, an outfielder does not catch a pop fly by computing a\\nprojectile trajectory equation. Instead, she predicts where the ball will fall\\nbased on sensory input, starting with the crack of the bat. She makes rapid\\nadjustments in speed and direction, reconciling predictions with the stream of\\nsensory input received as the ball approaches.</p>\\n<p>It turns out this predictive capability is a fundamental principle of\\nintelligence.  You constantly make small predictions of what you will see, feel\\nor hear. When you drink coffee, you make a series of predictions about the\\nsensory feedback you’ll receive as you bring the cup to your mouth.  You’re\\nusually unaware of these predictions unless they are violated.  For example if\\nthe coffee is cold, or you accidentally grabbed a cup of pens, you are\\nsurprised.  Detecting such anomalies is the flip side of making predictions, and\\nthe brain uses both to drive behavior.</p>\\n<p>This activity occurs in the neocortex, the wrinkled outer part of your brain.\\nWhen you are born, your brain is essentially an empty vessel with structure but\\nno content.  As you are continuously bombarded with input from your senses, you\\nbegin to build a model of the world, based on the recurring patterns that you\\nsee.</p>\\n<p>And “bombarded” is an understatement.  Vision alone consists of an array of a\\nmillion fibers on your optic nerve, flipping on and off in milliseconds. What\\nyou see is not “projected” inside your head.  Instead, the input from your eyes\\nare electrical impulses transmitted at an\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jul06/retinput.htm\\\">estimated 10 million bits per second</a>,\\ntranslated in the darkness of your skull into our perception of images.</p>\\n<p>In sum, you take massive streams of input, learn patterns to make models of\\neverything in your world, and make predictions to generate action: a predictive\\nmodeling memory system. Your brain is actually far superior to computers at the\\ngeneralized tasks of learning and pattern recognition (although obviously we\\ncan’t compete with computers at executing tasks quickly and accurately).  Grok’s\\ngoal is to combine the best of both worlds.  Future posts will summarize three\\nkey attributes of human intelligence that we implemented in Grok: Sparse\\nDistributed Representations (SDRs), sequence memory and adaptive learning. For\\nfurther reading: the basic principles of intelligence are described in Jeff\\nHawkins’ book, <em>On Intelligence</em>.

For those who watched it, it was a tremendously exciting game. In\\nfact the events of the last few minutes had a significant effect on our Sparse\\nPool result!</p>\\n<p>We promised to explain how the Sparse Football Pool relates to the brain, the\\nCLA (Numenta’s Cortical Learning Algorithm) and Intelligence.  The CLA relies on\\nSparse Distributed Representations, a form of information representation where\\nyou have a bunch of 0s and 1s.  Most of the numbers are 0s and a few of them\\nare 1s (hence the term “Sparse”).  In fact, each entry to the pool was an\\nSDR—nine 1s and twenty-one 0s. SDRs are also the fundamental way our\\nbrain represents information. At any point in time, most of the neurons in our\\nbrain are quiet and a small percentage of them are firing. It turns out that\\nthis form of representation can have some really interesting properties.\\nI constructed the Football Pool specifically so I could highlight some of\\nthese points. In the brain the numbers are, of course, far larger and the\\nsituation is a lot more complex, but we can illustrate the basic concepts\\nusing the Pool.</p>\\n<h4>Numerical Properties Of SDRs</h4>\\n<p>Even though there are only a small number of 1s, systems using SDRs can uniquely\\nrepresent a massive number of patterns.  Let’s ask the following question: given\\nthat you can only select 9 True answers out of 30, how many unique entries are\\nthere?  The answer turns out to be larger than you might guess: there are\\n14,307,150 possible unique entries! (I know that sounds like a lot—it’s\\nbased on a concept called\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficients#Computing_the_value_of_binomial_coefficients\\\">&quot;binomial coefficients&quot;</a>).\\nIn Grok our patterns have 40 bits on out of 2048.  The number of unique patterns\\nis an unimaginably large 2.37 x 10^84! Give or take 10^80.</p>\\n<p>What is the chance someone else can have the exact same answer as you? Assuming\\neverything is random, that’s just the flip side of the above question: it is 1\\nin 14,307,150. Even your identical twin would have a hard time guessing your\\nanswer.</p>\\n<p>What is the chance of someone getting a perfect score?  There were 12 Trues in\\nthe final answer. Picking any 9 out of those 12 would be fine. There are 220\\npossible perfect answers, so again, if everything was random, the chance of\\ngetting a perfect score is about 220/14,307,150, or about 1 in 65,032.</p>\\n<p>OK, even if you don’t get a perfect score, what is a good score?  The chance of\\ngetting a score of 8 is 1 in 28,903. The chance of getting a 7 is still very\\nrare: only 1 in 18,065.    Now, here’s a puzzler: we had less than 150 entries\\nyet two people had a score of 7. How is this possible? Either the constellations\\nwere lined up perfectly, or there is something else going on. Turns out we can\\nignore astrology—there is another answer. The fact that a highly\\nimprobable event occurred tells us that there is something really non-random\\nhappening.</p>\\n<h4>Semantic Properties Of SDRs</h4>\\n<p>The world is not random, and neither were the questions. The questions were\\ngrouped into similar semantic categories and the SDR corresponding to each entry\\nrepresents these semantics.  Here are four aspects of this:</p>\\n<p><strong>SDRs can represent specific information:</strong>  Each person’s answer reveals\\nsomething about the way they thought about the game.  This could be very\\nspecific. Suppose you answered True to Question 11 (Frank Gore will rush for\\nmore yards than Ray Rice). That tells us you predicted Frank Gore would do well.</p>\\n<p><strong>SDRs can represent complex information:</strong>  Suppose you answered True to\\nquestions 2, 3, 5, 14, 17, 21, and 22 (Question Group 1 below). This probably\\nmeans you predicted it would be an exciting game.   On the other hand if you\\nanswered True to questions 6, 9, 10, 11, 16, 19, 23, 24, and 26 (Question Group\\n2 below) it means you predicted the 49ers were going to dominate the Ravens.\\nSo, SDRs can represent something specific but can also implicitly represent\\ncomplex high level information. Isn’t that a key to intelligence and intelligent\\nrepresentations?</p>\\n<p><strong>SDRs represent subtle variations using a distributed code:</strong>  The questions\\nare “overlapping” and so the information is distributed. For example, questions\\n2, 3, and 5 in Group 1 have a lot in common. This means you don’t have to answer\\nTrue to all the questions in Group 1. Even answering True to, say, any 3 or 4 of\\nthem would be sufficient to tell us you thought the game was going to be\\nexciting. You can convey more or less subtlety by choosing exactly which ones\\nyou answer as True.  A partial answer tells us something about your thoughts and\\nno particular answer is critical. This is exactly analogous to the brain: a\\nsparse set of active neurons can represent lots of subtlety and complexity.</p>\\n<p><strong>SDRs can simultaneously represent multiple independent concepts:</strong>  If you\\nanswered True to, say, any 4 of the first set, and any 5 from the second set it\\nmeans you believed both propositions: the game was going to be exciting, but in\\nthe end the 49ers were going to beat the Ravens. The ability to simultaneously\\nrepresent independent concepts is another property of SDRs.  It is particularly\\nimportant when you are making predictions. Grok’s algorithms (and neurons) use\\nthis property to make simultaneous predictions about the future in a single\\nstep.</p>\\n<p>Can we use all this to say something about our winners? If you look at our\\nwinner, Ryan, it looks like he basically guessed that the game would be pretty\\nexciting and that the 49er stars would have a good statistical game. Our second\\nplace entry (also with a score of 7) guessed that the game would be exciting and\\nthat the Ravens would win. Their guesses weren’t perfect, but their basic\\nhunches ended up being correct and hence they had a high overlap score.  This\\ncould only have happened in a non-random world, with meaningful SDRs.\\nConversely, if you answered the questions randomly, you probably didn’t do too\\nwell!</p>\\n<p>We have touched on a few properties of SDRs, some of them subtle. You can\\nrepresent semantic properties and concepts.  You can represent both very\\nspecific and very subtle concepts.  You can represent multiple concepts\\nsimultaneously and this can be used in prediction. Grok (and our brain) relies\\non all of these properties and more.   Of course, there are many other aspects\\nof Grok (such as learning SDRs) that we didn’t cover here.</p>\\n<p>To wrap up, I hope you gained some insight into the power of SDRs and how our\\nbrains represent information.

In 1943 they were\\nthe first to propose creating networks of\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron\\\">artificial neurons</a>. They\\nshowed that artificial neurons could act like logic gates (AND, OR, etc.) and by\\nconnecting them in precise ways we could implement any digital logic. It was\\nground breaking work but biologically unrealistic.</p>\\n<p>Neural networks remained a minor research area for many years until they\\nresurfaced in a big way in the 1980s.  This was partly due to the rediscovery of\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation\\\">back propagation</a>, which is a\\nmethod of training simple neural networks, and it was partly due to a two volume\\nbook called\\n<em><a href=\\\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/parallel-distributed-processing\\\">Parallel Distributed Processing</a>.</em>\\nThe PDP books ignited interest in the field.  At this time I was already\\nconvinced that the path to machine intelligence required understanding how the\\nbrain works so I welcomed the new interest in neural networks.  Up to that\\npoint in time, symbolic and engineered approaches to A.I. were the dominant\\napproaches to machine intelligence.</p>\\n<p>However, I quickly became disillusioned with the new neural networks.  The\\nbiggest problem was they ignored time.  Brains process flowing streams of\\nsensory data.  All inference, prediction, and motor behavior in a brain is built\\nupon memory of sequences of patterns.\\nThe vast majority of artificial neural networks completely ignored time and\\nhence were unable to process changing inputs or generate behavior.  Without\\nembracing temporal patterns I felt we would not get close to capturing\\nintelligence.</p>\\n<p>There were other problems with the simplistic neural networks of the 1980s.\\nBiological neurons have thousands or tens of thousands of synapses arranged on\\ndendrites which have non-linear properties; artificial neurons typically had\\njust a few synapses on a cell body and ignored dendrite properties.  Biological\\nneural networks have detailed prototypical architectures; artificial neural\\nnetworks ignored these architectures. Neuroscience was starting to develop\\noverall theories of brain function but artificial neural networks were simple\\nclassifiers that didn’t fit within an overall theory.  Basically, for many years\\nmost artificial neural network research ignored neurobiology and their\\napplications remained limited to simple classification.  When most people think\\nof artificial neural networks they think about the type of neural networks\\nexplored in the 1980s.</p>\\n<p>Today the term “artificial neural network” can refer to many different types of\\nnetworks.  Some strive for biological realism and some don’t.  So when I am\\nasked if Numenta’s Cortical Learning Algorithm is a neural network, I reply\\n&quot;Yes, but there many types of neural networks.  If you want to compare the CLA\\nto other neural networks, ask do those other networks learn sequences, do they\\nlearn in an on-line fashion, do they incorporate neurons that have non-linear\\ndendrites, do they form thousands of connections, does the architecture of the\\nnetwork reflect the known architecture of any part of the brain, and does the\\nnetwork fit within a larger theory of brain function?&quot;  The number of artificial\\nneural networks that fit these criteria is small.  The CLA is one of them.</p>\\n<p>BTW, there is one type of early artificial neural network that was applied to\\nsequences.  These are called auto-associative memories.  In another blog post I\\nwill describe how the CLA and auto-associative memories are related.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Jeff Hawkins</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2013/02/19/not-your-fathers-neural-network.md\n ** module id = 772\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Jeff Hawkins\",\"brief\":\"Last month the Obama administration announced a new ten year $3B science initiative called the \\\"Brain Activity Map Project\\\" (BAM).

It was a\\nsuccess. But mapping the brain’s activities is not a singular thing like mapping\\nthe human genome.  People don’t agree on what it means to map the brain or what\\nsuccess looks like.  At the moment it isn’t clear exactly what BAM will try to\\nachieve.  Regardless, we can be confident that the BAM initiative will\\naccelerate our understanding of brains.  But there are several ways this can go.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"http://www.nih.gov/\\\">NIH (National Institutes of Health)</a> will likely to do\\nmost of the funding for BAM as it did for the Human Genome Project.  Since the\\nNIH focuses almost exclusively on diseases, BAM research will be pushed in\\ndirections that may not be best for reverse engineering the brain and building\\nintelligent machines.  For example, there is a split in the neuroscience world\\nbetween scientists who study relatively simple nervous systems (such as worms\\nand slugs) and those who study the neocortex which is what makes humans\\nintelligent.   The BAM initiative has stated they will start with invertebrates.\\nUnderstanding invertebrate nervous systems may lead to a better understanding of\\nhow brains grow or how neurons work and fail, but it is less likely to lead to a\\nbetter understanding of intelligence.  For that you have to study the neocortex\\nwhich only exists in mammals.</p>\\n<p>On the other hand,\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.darpa.mil/\\\">DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration)</a>\\nis also part of BAM.  DARPA is interested in machine intelligence and robotics.\\nBAM dollars that get allocated through DARPA are more likely to advance our\\nunderstanding of intelligence and more likely to lead to advances in\\npractical hardware for machine intelligence.</p>\\n<p>National research agendas such as BAM sometimes don’t succeed.  In the 1980’s\\nJapan created the\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer\\\">Fifth Generation Computer Systems Project</a>,\\na bold plan to leapfrog the rest of the world in computer science and artificial\\nintelligence. It failed despite concerted effort and hundreds of millions of\\ndollars of funding.  Will BAM be a success like the Human Genome Project or a\\nfailure like the Fifth Generation Computer Systems Project?  Will BAM accelerate\\nbrain theory and machine intelligence or just lead to better understanding of\\ndisease?  It is too early to answer these questions.  It depends on what goals\\nare chosen and who allocates the funds.</p>\\n<p>I am optimistic that good things will emerge from BAM but I don’t expect it will\\nachieve the stated goals.  Mapping the human genome is a far easier problem than\\nrecording from and mapping every neuron in a brain.  Mapping the genome is like\\nreading letters on a very long tape.  You can make millions of copies of the\\ntape and divide up the mapping task among thousands of tape reading machines.\\nMapping a brain is like finding the personal relationships of every human on\\nEarth and keeping track of what each person is doing at every moment in time.\\nThe size of the problem is daunting but the biggest difficulty is that the\\nconnections between neurons, like our relationships, are unique and constantly\\nchanging.  When it comes to the human neocortex, there is no singular map.  We\\ncan take analogies like this only so far, my point is that mapping the human\\nbrain is qualitatively harder than mapping the genome.  Even if BAM does\\nsucceed, a complete map of a brain is not going to tell us how it works or what\\ncauses mental diseases.</p>\\n<p>The activity and connection maps envisioned by BAM will be useful, but brain\\ntheorists today are not lacking in empirical data.  We haven’t come close to\\nunderstanding the tremendous amount of data we already have.  If we want to\\nunderstand how brains work, then a better direction is to focus on brain theory,\\nnot brain mapping.  We should set goals for brain theory and goals for machine\\nintelligence tasks based on those theories.  That is what we do at Numenta.  For\\nexample, we set goals to understand how neurons in the neocortex form sparse\\ndistributed representations and then how they learn to predict future events.\\nThis resulted in\\n<a href=\\\"http://numenta.org/cla.html\\\">Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA)</a> which is the\\nheart of our Grok streaming prediction engine.  The next big theoretical\\nchallenge we are working on is how the cortex generates behaviors from\\npredictions, what is sometimes called the sensory-motor integration problem.</p>\\n<p>Those of us who are interested in brain theory and machine intelligence should\\nbe happy about BAM regardless of how it plays out.  But we shouldn’t rely on it\\nto advance brain theory or machine intelligence any time soon.  I am working on\\na set of brain theory goals that will accelerate progress in machine\\nintelligence.

We think Numenta\\nand CEP are highly complementary and I wanted to take a moment to explain why.</p>\\n<p>A key capability of CEP systems is that they can perform database-like\\noperations on streaming data - queries, joins, aggregations, mathematical\\noperations, etc.  As data comes in, the results of these operations are\\ncontinuously updated. Need an instantaneous summary of your firm’s market\\npositions? Need to know what the current load is on your cell sites? CEP systems\\nare built to answer these types of questions and to do it continuously.</p>\\n<p>The second hallmark of CEP systems is triggering action. Knowing that your house\\nis on fire is certainly important, but you really want to take action to put out\\nthe fire. CEP systems also allow you to create business logic around streaming\\ndata and then drive action from it.  If a real-time key performance indicator is\\nexceeded, logic can be written in the CEP system to trigger a response and take\\naction.</p>\\n<p>This combination of capabilities - working with real-time data and creating a\\nframework of logic around it - enable many companies to set aside legacy code\\nbases for more flexible CEP environments.  Because of this flexibility, you\\noften find CEP systems at the heart of many real-time operational systems.</p>\\n<h4>Grok extends CEP into the future</h4>\\n<p>As we implement pilot projects with customers who use CEP, we’ve come to\\nappreciate how Grok can be a powerful and valuable extension to their CEP\\ndeployments.</p>\\n<p>In a nutshell, Grok makes it easy to get predictions from and find anomalies in\\ndata streams. It’s certainly helpful to know what is happening now, but the next\\nlogical question to ask is, “what will happen next?”</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/cep-arrow.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Image\\\" title=\\\"Numenta and CEP Systems\\\"></p>\\n<p>The simple view is that business intelligence systems are focused on historical\\ndata, CEP systems focus on what is happening right now, and Grok is focused on\\nwhat is most likely to happen in the future.</p>\\n<h4>Real-time prediction</h4>\\n<p>One of the pillars of Grok is its ability to develop high quality predictive\\nmodels automatically.  Data streams being used by a CEP system can be trivially\\nrepurposed to build predictive models of the data.  The predictions from the\\nGrok models can then be easily brought back into the CEP environment.</p>\\n<p>No doubt you’ve heard that building good enterprise scale predictive models can\\nbe hard for us humans.  When you have thousands of data streams and you want to\\nalways use the latest information, it becomes even more challenging. Grok can\\nbuild custom models for each data stream and do it automatically in a way that\\nis always up to date.</p>\\n<p>Grok can provide customers with CEP systems with high quality predictions about\\nwhat is most likely to happen and this information can be added to the mix of\\noperational information to make the best decision and take the most appropriate\\nactions.</p>\\n<h4>Move from hand-built triggers to adaptive modelling</h4>\\n<p>In addition to modelling many data streams automatically, Grok can also make the\\nbusiness logic that drives the action from CEP systems much more flexible and\\nadaptive.</p>\\n<p>Many CEP applications look at thresholds of real time data and when these\\nthresholds are violated, actions are triggered. One problem is that it can be a\\ntedious and error prone task to configure these thresholds.

Businesses operate in a world that is constantly evolving\\nand your systems can’t be hard-coded to the past.</p>\\n<p>Grok models learn continuously from data. Even when Grok is looking for\\nanomalies, its models can adapt to find the “new normal” in your data, while\\nstill recognizing important historical anomalies.  This adaptive behavior, when\\npaired with CEP’s ability to act on data, is required if you want to drive\\nintelligent action from your operational data.</p>\\n<p>With Grok’s focus on streaming data, automated model building, and continuous\\nlearning, we believe that Grok is an ideal match for CEP applications in\\nfinance, energy, and telecommunications.</p>\\n<p>I should mention that there are a number of excellent CEP system on the market,\\nproducts like <a href=\\\"http://bit.ly/13P4QF6\\\">Oracle OEP</a>,\\n<a href=\\\"http://bit.ly/14CJutu\\\">Sybase ESP</a>,\\n<a href=\\\"http://ibm.co/12dbr7a\\\">IBM InfoSphere Streams</a>, and others.

Businesses need real-time solutions that\\ncan keep up with the accelerating pace and scale of information they are\\ncollecting. This is why one of the key features that Grok models incorporate is\\n<strong>online learning</strong> (a technical term our marketing department has\\naffectionately changed to “continuous learning”). In this post, I’ll talk a\\nlittle bit about online learning and why we think it is so important for solving\\nthe types of problems that Grok tackles.</p>\\n<h4>What is online learning?</h4>\\n<p>Most machine learning systems are what are called <strong>batch learning systems</strong>.\\nThis means that they are trained once on a static set of data, called the\\n<strong>training dataset</strong>. The model that is learned from this training set is then\\nused to make predictions for additional data, called the <strong>test dataset</strong>. This\\napproach assumes that the data is stationary, i.e. that the statistical patterns\\nin the data do not change over time. By contrast, in an online learning system\\nthere is no distinction between training and test data. Every record updates the\\nmodel with new information. Therefore, an online learning model never stops\\nlearning and always uses the most recent information. Online learning systems do\\nnot assume any stationarity in the data. As patterns in the data change, the\\nmodel adapts and learns these new patterns.</p>\\n<p>You might be thinking, “But Rahul, can’t you just take a batch learning system\\nand retrain it periodically? Wouldn’t that also allow the model to adapt?” To\\nthis I would say two things, “1) How did you know my name? 2) Yes you can.”\\nHowever, as I will discuss below, this approach is often suboptimal or not\\nfeasible for real-time streaming data problems</p>\\n<h4>What are streaming data problems?</h4>\\n<p>Grok builds models to make predictions on <strong>real-time streaming data</strong>. This is\\nhigh frequency, usually machine-generated data. These data streams measure the\\nchange in one or many variables as they change over time. An example of\\nstreaming data is measurements from temperature sensors placed on a piece of\\nindustrial equipment, such as a wind turbine. Another example could be the CPU\\nand memory usage of a server in a server farm. Recent data is exponentially more\\nvaluable than old data. Our founder, Jeff Hawkins, talks about this idea as the\\n“half-life” of data. For example, a web company may release a new feature that\\ndramatically increases traffic to its servers. Any external factors make\\nstreaming data inherently non-stationary, indicating that online learning or\\nretraining is a necessity. Therefore, being able to incorporate the latest data\\ninto a model as soon as possible offers a huge advantage.</p>\\n<h4>Why online learning helps: Fast Data</h4>\\n<p>One issue with retraining batch systems is that it is often too slow to be\\nfeasible. Many batch machine learning algorithms are optimized to have long,\\ncomputationally expensive training phases in order to be faster during testing.\\nThis is because training is assumed to happen rarely, often only once.</p>\\n<p>One of the reasons many popular batch learning algorithms are slow is that they\\nrely on iterative optimization techniques as a subroutine for learning. This\\nmeans that they perform the same computation over the training set for many\\niterations until the parameters of the model converge (given some convergence\\ncriteria). These iterative algorithms can potentially take a long time to run\\ndepending on how quickly the model converges. Take the popular sequence learning\\nalgorithm, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The algorithm to train a full HMM from\\nunlabeled data, called the <strong>Baum-Welch algorithm</strong>, is an iterative algorithm\\nwhere <em>each step</em> has complexity <strong>O(K^2N)</strong>, where <strong>K</strong> is the number of\\nstates in the model, and <strong>N</strong> is the number of records in the training set.\\nThis means, even for a moderate number of states, each iteration of the\\noptimization process could take a significant amount of time. Even algorithms\\nthat are generally considered more efficient, such as Support Vector Machines\\n(SVMs), still require iterative algorithms during training, introducing an\\nindeterminate, potentially large amount of computation. For streaming data\\nproblems, it would be infeasible to retrain models on every record because the\\ntraining process would be too slow to keep up with the data. Even worse, for\\nvery high frequency cases, the data might be coming in so fast that the model is\\nobsolete by the time it is retrained! In an on-line training system such as Grok\\neach new data point is presented just once an Grok can update its model in a few\\ntens of milliseconds.</p>\\n<h4>Why online learning helps: Many Models</h4>\\n<p>In addition to speed, another advantage of Grok is that it allows you to easily\\ntrain and deploy hundreds and thousands of models. That means you can deploy a\\nseparate model for each turbine in your wind farm, or for each node in your data\\ncenter. At this scale, it becomes costly to store the large amounts of data for\\neach model in order to retrain them. Instead, online models allow you to “fire-\\nand-forget” your data. An online learning algorithm learns as soon as a new\\nrecord is fed to it. After that, there is no need to keep the original record,\\nas the model has already incorporated the new information by updating it’s own\\nparameters.</p>\\n<p>Even if you can find enough storage for these records, you still have to make a\\nfundamental decision: how often do you retrain? This is not a trivial decision,\\nand it requires the modeler to make certain assumptions about how long the\\nsequential patterns are in the data. There is also a tradeoff between the size\\nof each training batch. Smaller batches allow you to update the models more\\nfrequently, but can lead to issues with data sparsity and overfitting, which\\nmeans that the model doesn’t learn all the different patterns that are present\\nin the data. On the other hand, larger batches will take longer to train on, and\\nit will take longer for models to incorporate the most recent data. In the case\\nof thousands of models, it will not be feasible to customize the batch size for\\neach model, so some assumption must be made to suit all models. Although online\\nlearning algorithms, such as our Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA), generally\\nhave some analogous “learning rate” parameter, Grok automatically determines the\\nbest value for each model during the swarming process, removing the need for the\\ndata scientist to select a value.</p>\\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\\n<p>While batch learning make sense for certain problem domains, online learning is\\nessential for high velocity streaming intelligence applications. While it is\\npossible to munge batch systems into online learning systems, it’s like fitting\\na square peg into a pentagonal hole. This is why Grok’s core technology\\nincorporates online learning from the start.  In fact, we think that for the\\nfuture of data (i.e. <em>streaming data</em>, if you were paying attention) online\\nlearning is a must-have feature.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2013/04/11/the-online-learning-advantage.md\n ** module id = 783\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"1ff2020454149a74a38ff3573f454f42.jpg\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2013/05/01/images/main.jpg\n ** module id = 786\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Rob Haitani\",\"brief\":\"Representations are patterns in a computer or a brain that represent something in the real world.

But how do you represent the relationship of things in the real world?\\nComing up with a label called “car” is easy; knowing a car is similar to a truck\\nor that it can be used for transportation is hard.  A car might be related to\\nhundreds of other objects in complicated ways.  This type of knowledge is\\nsurprisingly difficult to capture in the precise realm of computers.</p>\\n<p>Your brain also forms representations.  The brain’s representations consist of\\nthe activity of neurons, which ultimately derive from the inputs from your\\nsenses.   The set of neurons representing “car” are fired when you see any car\\nfrom any direction, in any lighting condition, even if a door is open or the car\\nis crumpled. To manage this complexity, you’d think that all of your neurons\\nmust be firing all the time, in a dense cacophony of activity.</p>\\n<p>You’d think.  But you’d be wrong.</p>\\n<p>No matter how furiously your brain is working, only a small percentage of\\nneurons are active at any given time. Most are silent, and the neurons that fire\\nactually inhibit other neurons nearby from firing. How can this be?</p>\\n<p>Let’s start by looking more closely at how computers represent data, which is\\nsometimes called “dense” representations.  In a computer representation there\\nare a relatively small number of bits, and all combinations of ones and zeroes\\nare used.  In ASCII code, for example, the string “01101101” represents the\\nletter “m.” The individual 1s and 0s mean nothing. The bits only have meaning as\\na group, and a programmer assigns the actual representations. This makes them\\ninflexible: if one bit is missing or changed, then the entire meaning changes or\\nis incomprehensible.  And an ASCII representation doesn’t tell you anything\\nabout the properties of the letter “m” it represents.</p>\\n<p>Sparse Distributed Representations, by contrast, consist of very long strings\\nthat are mostly 0s.  Grok representations usually have 2,000 digits, of which\\nonly 2% (or about 40) are 1s. This emulates the sparsity in the brain, where\\nonly a few cells are active at any time.  However, each of the 1s has meaning.\\nImagine a game similar to Twenty Questions, except that you can ask 2,000\\nquestions.  It turns out you can build a system where any given word has a &quot;Yes&quot;\\nanswer to about 40 of those questions, and “No” for everything else.  Note that\\nif any two words share a “Yes” for the same question, they have something in\\ncommon.  For example, both might be people, or both might be bigger than a\\nbreadbox.  Also, the questions and answers are not assigned, but are learned\\nthrough repeated observation.</p>\\n<p>Continuing the analogy, let’s say you want to store this information. You don’t\\nhave to record the answers to all 2,000 questions. You can store the numbers of\\nthe 40 questions that had “Yes” answers (in computer terms, you can store an\\nindex of active bits).  You can even take a random sample of 10 “Yes” answers,\\nand still confidently identify your word.  This is more like Name That\\nTune—I can name that word in ten “Yes” answers. If you do the math, it\\nturns out that it is extremely unlikely that you will guess the wrong word if\\nyou know ten of the correct “Yes” answers. But even if you did, it would still\\nshare ten common attributes, so your mistake would represent something else that\\nwas similar.  This principle of “semantic generalization” is a critical\\ndifferentiating factor between flexible brains and “brittle” artificial\\nintelligence.  Humans effortlessly use synonyms: “car,” “Prius,” &quot;automobile,&quot;\\netc.  And our perception also degrades gracefully.  If you only see the hood of\\na car, or a car with someone in front of it, or read the letters &quot;autmobile,&quot;\\nyou filter out the noise and extract the essence of “car” from the partial\\npattern you see.</p>\\n<p>To summarize, SDRs are very long strings of mostly 0s that represent knowledge\\nand meaning, and form the “language” of the brain. The principles of SDRs enable\\nflexible recognition of similar patterns, and graceful degradation of noisy\\ninput. As a result, it is difficult to imagine how to build machine intelligence\\nwithout SDRs. The next post in this series will discuss how SDRs are used to\\nlearn patterns.</p>\\n<p>Further information:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://numenta.org/cla-white-paper.html\\\">CLA white paper</a>.

As I described in <em>On Intelligence</em>, the brain is a\\nprediction machine, one that builds models from streaming data and constantly\\nmakes predictions.  A large part of our research has been to understand exactly\\nhow the neocortex learns and makes predictions. The Cortical Learning Algorithm\\n(CLA), included in our NuPIC open source project, was a major advance in that\\ndirection.</p>\\n<p>We also feel it is imperative to find valuable applications for brain-based\\ntechnology today.  So for the past two years we built a prediction engine based\\non the CLA and started the process of investigating commercial applications.\\nAlthough we found applications for prediction in many industries, and the CLA\\nworked well in those applications, there were substantial barriers to being able\\nto act on predictions within existing business processes.  Further, we learned\\nthat there was equal or greater interest in anomaly detection, the “flip side”\\nof prediction.</p>\\n<p>With this knowledge we looked at the state-of-the-art in anomaly detection\\ntechnology.  We also interviewed many people who use anomaly detection products\\nin their daily routines.  We quickly learned two things.  One is that simple-to-\\nuse products, ones that don’t require machine learning experts, didn’t perform\\nwell.  Every person we talked to told us about getting too many false positives\\nand/or too many false negatives.  The second thing we learned is that existing\\ntools are designed to be used in data centers, but they caused frustration when\\npeople were away from the data center or away from the office.  A surprising\\nnumber of people we interviewed told us that they turned off alerts altogether.</p>\\n<p>We realized that by using the CLA and applying our understanding of\\nneuroscience, we could take a fresh approach, and create a substantially better\\nanomaly detection engine.  We also felt we could reinvent how anomalous events\\nare reported and explored, by creating a new type of mobile interface.  Our\\nproduct, Grok, is the result.  Grok advances the state-of-the-art in anomaly\\ndetection technology and it replaces SMS’s, and email alerts with a fun and\\npowerful mobile application.  In just a few seconds on your mobile phone you can\\nsee which of your applications and servers are acting unusually and if they need\\nfurther attention.</p>\\n<p>I’ve written a paper that explains how we have applied the science of the CLA to\\nthe technology of anomaly detection.  It illustrates how a simple-to-use product\\ncan detect anomalies with subtlety and sophistication by using cortical models.\\nI hope you’ll read it and see why I’m so excited.  In my view, this is one of\\nthe first products based on neocortical principles, a system that learns\\npatterns from its temporal data stream, makes predictions, and identifies\\nanomalies.

So I clicked on the notification and looked at the graph.\\nWhat followed was interesting and eye opening!</p>\\n<p>It turns out that on that night Amazon’s East coast datacenter, US-East-1, had\\nsome problems. AWS API call latencies slowly increased. Eventually by about 8:40\\nPM API calls were so slow as to be practically unusable.   Any applications on\\nthose servers relying on the AWS API were unusable.</p>\\n<p>Below are two screen shots from the Grok mobile application showing the Hourly\\nview and the Day view for that time period.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/1.png\\\" alt=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\" title=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\"></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/2.png\\\" alt=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\" title=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\"></p>\\n<p>Notice that Grok flagged unusual behavior at 8pm, 35 minutes before Amazon’s API\\nbecame completely unresponsive on the East Coast.</p>\\n<p>To understand this better, here’s a bit of information about this server.\\n“test02” is a test server running an instance of Grok.  We have servers in\\nmultiple regions but this particular server sits in US-East-1 and was affected\\nby the incident.  Our servers make lots of outgoing API calls as is typical for\\nAWS applications.   The blue line shows CPU load on test02. As API calls slowed\\ndown, retries and lags increased and the CPU load started became a bit wonky.\\nEventually Cloudwatch became unresponsive and the data stopped coming in. The\\nreally cool thing is that the alert happened 35 minutes before that point.\\nLuckily test02 is just a test server. We keep most of our production stuff in\\nUS-West so this didn’t directly affect us. However I do know that plenty of US-\\nEast users were affected and could have benefited greatly from an early warning.</p>\\n<p>It is useful to think about whether this could have been caught by some other\\nmechanism. First, any threshold based alerting system would NOT have caught the\\nanomaly. CPU load of 66% is not unusual at all for this server.  In fact there\\nare times when the CPU goes close to 100% when this server trains new models so\\nthat’s out. A system looking at our service latencies would not have detected\\nanything either – our web server was actually perfectly responsive the entire\\ntime. An anomaly detection scheme that relies on averages and standard\\ndeviations would not have worked. The incident happened too fast, within just a\\nfew 5-minute samples. A statistical technique that made a decision that fast\\nwould lead to tons of false positives on noisy data (including normal usage when\\nCPU jumps to 100%!).  You can see in the hour view how fast Grok turned red –\\nGrok uses temporal sequences to detect unusual behavior. A more sophisticated\\ntraining mechanism that relies on classifying known patterns also wouldn’t have\\nworked. I have never seen this behavior before and would not have been able to\\npredict it.</p>\\n<p>Isn’t that the whole point though? We need a system that automatically detects\\nthe unknown unknowns.</p>\\n<p>The above are actual snapshots from my smartphone for our server and this is an\\nactual incident (I admit I dramatized the first paragraph – let’s blame\\nmarketing for that :-). For the record, below is a snapshot of the AWS status\\npage. Amazon states that no instances were affected and this is true – we can\\nattest that our machines kept running fine. On the other hand, any code that\\nrelied on the AWS API was drastically affected by this incident.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/3.png\\\" alt=\\\"AWS Screenshot\\\" title=\\\"AWS Screenshot\\\"></p>\\n<p>In general AWS does an amazing job of keeping their infrastructure up and\\nrunning but occasional incidents do happen. These incidents are unpredictable\\nand they are unavoidable. It is comforting to know that Grok can give me a heads\\nup and some lead-time to investigate and figure out what to do. In a production\\ncontext I would have had plenty of time to spin up servers in another region and\\nredirect my traffic there.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/04/04/anomaly-of-the-week.md\n ** module id = 794\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"8c6cfcc623aea4deec25abdfb3a5a719.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/04/04/images/1.png\n ** module id = 795\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"2744b9665e65a762619fad8f30e11618.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/04/04/images/2.png\n ** module id = 796\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"21d63de3d3d61b29390d144200d65bc2.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/04/04/images/3.png\n ** module id = 797\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"79f0319bfa664221750c186f29cf48c9.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/04/04/images/image.png\n ** module id = 798\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"b9abfa77bcb4719586ff3f05fa5e7e15.jpg\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/04/04/images/main.jpg\n ** module id = 799\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"6558aadf8d56f345e1748dbcf710da65.jpg\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/04/04/images/main@2x.jpg\n ** module id = 800\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Jared Casner\",\"brief\":\"Like most engineering managers, I like to know when someone is manually touching one of our servers.

When this happened, I got a\\nnotification sent to my phone, telling me to check out DDD’s anomalous behavior.\\nI quickly got online and watched the action live, as the price skyrocketed and\\nthen dropped back down. If I’d actually had DDD in my portfolio, I would’ve\\nknown that the price spiked, and would’ve seen it drop back down by the end of\\nthe day. It’s very convenient to be told when a share is doing something like\\nthis, rather than having to watch multiple prices during the day.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/2.png\\\" alt=\\\"Grok Anomaly Chart\\\" title=\\\"Grok Anomaly Chart\\\"></p>\\n<p>Interestingly, we don’t see any anomalies after the first red peak on the\\nanomaly chart. This is because Grok, by default, suppresses additional anomalies\\nfor an hour after an initial detection—the red peak on the chart is synonymous\\nwith a detected anomaly. Since Grok fires off a cell phone notification every\\ntime it sees an anomaly, we decided we didn’t want to spam the user with\\nmultiple notifications within a certain time period. If you look closely at the\\ngraph, you can even see the perfectly flat section for about 1 hour after the\\ninitial red anomaly. If we didn’t have this suppression turned on, we’d expect\\nto see additional anomalies detected around 8:40 and 9:05 that day.</p>\\n<p>I’m writing this post a week after this event, and the press has had some time\\nto catch up. There are a few speculative reasons for this price spike, including\\na change in management [1], the launch of a new 3d scanner for the iPad [2], and\\nnews of recent advancements in medical-grade 3D printing which will allow for\\nantibiotic-infused implants [3]. This is pretty exciting news, all of which I likely\\nwouldn’t have noticed if it weren’t for Grok.</p>\\n<p>[1] <a href=\\\"http://www.marketnewscall.com/volume-buzzers-3d-systems-corporation-nyseddd-ezchip-semiconductor-ltd-nasdaqezch/1231261/\\\">http://www.marketnewscall.com/volume-buzzers-3d-systems-corporation-nyseddd-ezchip-semiconductor-ltd-nasdaqezch/1231261/</a></p>\\n<p>[2] <a href=\\\"http://www.gaininggreen.com/computer-peripherals-3d-systems-corporation-nyseddd-logitech-international-sa-nasdaqlogi-electronics-for-imaging-nasdaqefii-universal-display-corporation-nasdaqoled-transact-technolog/1239893/\\\">http://www.gaininggreen.com/computer-peripherals-3d-systems-corporation-nyseddd-logitech-international-sa-nasdaqlogi-electronics-for-imaging-nasdaqefii-universal-display-corporation-nasdaqoled-transact-technolog/1239893/</a></p>\\n<p>[3] <a href=\\\"http://3dprint.com/7793/3d-print-antibiotics-implants/\\\">http://3dprint.com/7793/3d-print-antibiotics-implants/</a></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/07/15/detecting-anomalies-in-stock-volumes.md\n ** module id = 809\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"c7507a154472a6135db7f5f6d450c9ec.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/07/15/images/1.png\n ** module id = 810\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"e79817bb70676fb00140ad523b4f15b9.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/07/15/images/2.png\n ** module id = 811\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"0385e5e059ad7b8888e9bf3e3b7ab653.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/07/15/images/image.png\n ** module id = 812\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"ae4f26fae66012e7700dbda9e7c2434d.jpg\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/07/15/images/main.jpg\n ** module id = 813\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Joe Block\",\"brief\":\"I saw a notification from Grok that our web server auto scaling group (ASG) was acting anomalously.

At first I thought it was only because we were seeing heavier than\\nusual traffic since we were mentioned in Information Week and VentureBeat, but\\nwhen I checked it out in Grok’s mobile app, I noticed a couple of odd and\\ninteresting things.</p>\\n<p>First, I saw an odd pattern in the NetworkIn graph - instead of a flattish line\\nwith minor variation and different sized rough edged spikes I’d expect from\\nregular web requests, or a line trending upward as the web traffic went up from\\nthe media mentions, what I was seeing was a stable line with very high, very\\nsharp spikes at regular intervals. On closer examination, the peak spikes were\\neven more suspicious - they were all very nearly the same size.</p>\\n<p>Secondly, Grok had also flagged the group’s CPU metric, and when I looked at it,\\nthe graph was very atypical. This ASG normally has a CPU load that hovers around\\n20%, and what I was seeing was hovering around 40-45% with surges to 100%. The\\nsurges were not as sharply edged as the network spikes, but there were still\\nsurges in load.</p>\\n<p>Finally, even though the CPU was staying above the level we’d configured our ASG\\nto add instances at, when I took a look at the ASG instance count it was still\\nhovering around the lower bound of the ASG’s size limit.</p>\\n<p>After staring at the individual graphs on the phone for a bit, I pulled up the\\nGrok web chart page so I could compare them to each other - sometimes I prefer\\nusing the web chart because it allows me to view more than one of an instance or\\nASG’s underlying metric graphs’ raw data charts at once, and also because by\\nviewing them on a 15 inch MacBook Pro screen instead of a phone, I can see a\\nbigger picture of what is going on. Sure enough, once I expanded the CPU and\\nNetworkIn underlying charts on my laptop I could see that the surges in CPU were\\nlagging behind the spikes in network, and I immediately got an idea of what was\\ngoing on, and a quick look at the ASG’s scaling history and the logs on a\\nfreshly started web server instance confirmed my suspicions.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/ASG-failing.png\\\" alt=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\" title=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\"></p>\\n<p>Here’s a little background about our web server back end auto scaling group. The\\nNumenta web site itself is stored in a git repository and uses a combination of\\ndocpad, nodejs and some custom scripts to render the static pages of the site\\nfrom various source assets. Each web server updates the local copy of the git\\nrepository every fifteen minutes, and if the master branch has changed, it\\nrenders the site and swaps the new rendered document directory tree into place.\\nThat’s the normal process, and because we’re using git we only have to download\\nthe changes in the source files since the last site update.</p>\\n<p>What was happening in this case though, was that the site renders were failing\\non fresh instances. So the ASG would spin up a new instance, the new instance\\nwould have to download the entire git repository, it would attempt to run the\\nbuild process and the build would fail. Then the health check script would run,\\nsee that the web server didn’t have a valid document root, report the instance\\nas unhealthy to the ASG, and the ASG would terminate the instance. Once the cool\\ndown expired, we’d lather, rinse and repeat. If all the old instances had gotten\\nterminated in the ASG, we’d have had downtime on the website since new instances\\nwere failing to become healthy and get added to the load balancer.</p>\\n<p>The reason the problem was only showing up on new instances was because the\\nsupport script was just checking that a particular component was installed, not\\nthat it was a specific version. When the upstream source for that component\\nupdated to a new version, it wasn’t compatible with our build process, so new\\ninstances would fail to build. The identically sized NetworkIn spikes were when\\na new instance started up and did the initial git clone of the website\\nrepository, and the wider CPU spikes were when the new instance would attempt to\\nrender the website’s static assets.</p>\\n<p>We resolved the issue in two ways. In the short term, we updated the build\\nscript so that it specified exact versions for all of its dependencies. This\\nstopped the new instance churn right away. In the long term, we stopped\\nrendering the site on the web servers - we had initially decided to build the\\nstatic site on the web server to eliminate machine-generated files from the\\nrepository, but now we pre-render everything and check the static site into the\\nrepository. It can be served immediately after a git pull and the web servers\\ndon’t have to do anything else when we update the web site content.</p>\\n<p>Here’s an example of the new, normal curves after all the fixes were put in\\nplace:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/ASG-healthy.png\\\" alt=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\" title=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\"></p>\\n<p>I could have figured this out without Grok, but I would have had to look at\\nevery metric for the ASG, then scrubbed through them to find where the anomalous\\nbehavior began, then rummaged through the log files, but, and this is an\\nimportant but, I wouldn’t have started looking until the last good web server\\nbackend failed and I got an alert that the website was down. Thresholds on the\\nCPU load or NetworkIn wouldn’t have helped me - the spikes I saw were what I\\nwould have expected to see when a new instance was added to the ASG, what made\\nthem unusual was how rapidly the instances were getting added and dropped.\\nInstead, Grok notified me when the anomalous behavior started, highlighted\\nexactly which metrics were showing the strange behavior, and let me compare them\\nto each other immediately so I could get good picture of the situation before I\\nstarted looking in my logs, and before the website actually went offline.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/07/22/cleanup-on-asg-3.md\n ** module id = 814\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"66e9f55fe31fd13150e4de1906e6fdeb.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/07/22/images/ASG-failing.png\n ** module id = 815\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"5424252a313a83348200d69aa60e9bb8.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/07/22/images/ASG-healthy.png\n ** module id = 816\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"cac1600f63fb45a7a100e7661ab20e65.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/07/22/images/image.png\n ** module id = 817\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"4fa9b91d52f06ed85797939a15837b4d.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/08/11/images/geo.png\n ** module id = 818\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"01b65b9ef816454107b105ffb0071b03.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/08/11/images/image.png\n ** module id = 819\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"78569420a5d443c25328e64784f8baea.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/08/11/images/motor.png\n ** module id = 820\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"a05824a7303265322a5dc56c7fb4f162.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/08/11/images/nlp.png\n ** module id = 821\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"9c6f11195a1cd4d6df485cde5119bef5.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/08/11/images/rogue.png\n ** module id = 822\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Nick DeFalco\",\"brief\":\"On the other hand, HTM machine intelligence – like your brain – comprises a single underlying processing method that is extensible across a wide range of applications.

My approach was to feed cost data to Grok to identify any anomalies\\nin spending relative to the normal pattern of spend.</p>\\n<p>Using Grok’s custom metrics, I sampled and fed AWS burnrate statistics into Grok\\nfor regional burnrates as well as instance counts. Since AWS instances vary in\\npricing, spinning up one EC2 I2-8xlarge instance could be just as much of a\\nproblem as spinning up several T2-micro instances. Therefore, even though most\\nanomalies would likely be caught by both metrics, I wanted to be sure that\\nunexpected corner-case anomalies would be caught too.</p>\\n<p>In fact, at the beginning of my experiment, the burnrate monitor was able to\\ndetect an anomaly in AWS’s us-east-1 region. For ease-of-use, most of the\\nservers we use reside in the us-west-2 region, however all of our testing for\\nmarketplace AMIs happens on us-east-1 servers. For that reason, early on August\\n4th, Grok detected an anomaly when our QA team began testing one of our\\nmarketplace candidates. Since Grok had learned the regular pattern of nightly\\nAMI tests, when all of a sudden an instance was manually created, Grok quickly\\nnotified me.</p>\\n<h5>Grok Web UI showing Normal Pattern</h5>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/1.png\\\" alt=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\"></p>\\n<h5>Grok Web UI showing anomaly due to launch of AMI tests</h5>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/2.png\\\" alt=\\\"Grok Screenshot\\\"></p>\\n<p>In this case because I knew the QA team was starting a new cycle of testing, I\\nwas able to easily identify the cause of the anomaly.  Nevertheless, it was\\nuseful that Grok identified the increased in instances and impact on costs. Had\\nI not expected the anomaly, I would have been able to quickly find the source of\\nthe problem, whether it be a faulty testing script that forgets to delete\\nautomatically created instances on failure, or an accidentally changed limit on\\nan auto-scaling group. In today’s dynamic and virtualized IT environments, it’s\\ngreat to have this peace of mind that jumps in costs outside of normal patterns\\ncan be identified quickly. Not only can Grok tell an engineer that a server is\\noperating normally, but it can also report to a senior manager that their\\ncompany isn’t incurring unexpected costs.</p>\\n<p>In use cases with noisier data (such as burnrate for our us-west-2 region where\\nmost of our instances are located), the burnrate monitor still excels at\\ndetecting anomalous spending. Large, anomalous jumps in spending that could be\\nattributed to a larger than usual instance being spun up or accidentally setting\\nthe minimum instance count of an auto-scaling group to 500 instead of 50 are\\nquickly recognized, enabling the proper team member to rapidly address the\\nissue. Rather than receiving an enormous (and unexpected) bill at the end of the\\nmonth, the cost and likelihood of a serious AWS mistake is substantially\\nmitigated.   During my experiment Grok was able to identify an anomaly due to an\\nerror in the configuration of our auto-scaling group, causing it to grow\\nunnecessarily large.

The stream of sensory\\ninputs is actively generated by execution of a series of motor commands. We call\\nthis new learning paradigm sensorimotor learning and prediction, or SLAP. To\\nunderstand how the algorithm works, let us first think of how our brain solves\\nthe same problem.</p>\\n<p>We know that all our remarkable cognitive abilities, object recognition, scene\\ninterpretation, reasoning and prediction, starts from data streams collected by\\nour “sensors”, such as retina at the back of eyes, tactile sensors under the\\nskin and auditory sensors in the cochlea. Believe it or not, most of the inputs\\nto the sensors are actually generated by ourselves, rather than by changes in\\nthe external world. Our eyes are constantly moving; our touch senses mostly\\narise from our own body movement, and the speech we generated is also picked up\\nby our auditory nerves. After we learn a new environment, we are rarely\\nsurprised by the consequences of our own actions. I can predict exactly what I\\nwill see after each turn on my way to work now. This prediction is based on my\\ncurrent sensory input and the motor command I am going to execute. Moreover,\\ndespite dramatic changes of input to my sensors, my internal perception is\\nstable. These two aspects reflect two component of the algorithm. We call the\\nprediction step “sensorimotor inference”, and the process of building stable\\nrepresentations as “temporal pooling”.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/1.png\\\" alt=\\\"Neuroscience Image\\\"></p>\\n<p>Jeff Hawkins described the basic ideas on the\\n<a href=\\\"http://numenta.org/lists/\\\">NuPIC mailing list</a>. During my internship I\\nimplemented and worked on several SLAP experiments using synthetic\\ndatasets. In one experiment, we trained the SLAP algorithm to recognize a large\\nnumber of synthetic images composed of “squares”. Each square is painted with\\ndifferent color and different images share the same set of colors. Two example\\nimages are shown below. A white diamond represents the portion of the image that\\nlies on the fovea, and a black arrow represents the proposed motor command.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/2.png\\\" alt=\\\"Neuroscience Image\\\"></p>\\n<p>The algorithm is allowed to explore each image through simulated eye-movements.\\nAt each step the image under the fovea and the motor command is fed to the\\nalgorithm. The first layer of the network learns to make predictions of the next\\nsensory input. The algorithm also utilizes a reasonable assumption that if two\\nthings are close to each other in time (temporal proximity), they tend to\\noriginate from the same underlying cause, and thus should be grouped together.\\nNeurons of the second layer “pool” over many neurons in the first layer, and\\nform a stable representation that is unique to each pattern. During learning,\\nstable representations will emerge despite changes to the input in the first\\nlayer. These stable representations indicate recognition of the larger image.</p>\\n<p>The figure below shows example output from a trained system while the eyes are\\nmoving around two different images (10 iterations for each image). At each step,\\nthe sensory input is changing drastically. However, the overall output is a\\nstable and unique representation for each image.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/3.png\\\" alt=\\\"Neuroscience Image\\\"></p>\\n<p>This simple example illustrates a fundamental mechanism our brain uses to create\\nstable representations from a changing world. The same mechanism can also be\\nused for a large variety of problems where the sensor data is actively generated\\nby the system, such as robot learning, vehicle control, and complex pattern\\nrecognition/detection problems.</p>\\n<p>Note: Some of my implementation code is now available in the\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/numenta/nupic.research\\\">nupic.research github repository</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2014/10/07/learning-through-active-exploration.md\n ** module id = 841\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Joe Block\",\"brief\":\"Using the burnrate custom metrics script with your Grok server\",\"date\":\"2014/12/15\",\"featured\":false,\"image\":\"../images/image.png\",\"org\":\"Site Reliability Engineer\",\"tags\":\"grok aws ec2 custom metrics burn rate numenta machine intelligence\",\"title\":\"Monitoring AWS EC2 Burnrate with Grok\",\"type\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Numenta has <a href=\\\"/press/numenta-announces-licensing-of-grok-for-it-to-avik-partners.html\\\">announced a strategic partnership with Avik Partners</a>,\\nplease read more about the future of\\n<a href=\\\"http://grokstream.com\\\">Grok for IT Analytics</a>.</p>\\n<p>A few months ago, we mentioned that we’re monitoring our AWS EC2 costs with\\nGrok.

Check out all of the\\n<a href=\\\"/legal/results/sparse-football-pool-ii-2015.html\\\">results here</a>\\nand see where you ranked.</p>\\n<p>So, how does the Sparse Football Pool relate to the brain, the HTM Learning\\nAlgorithms and intelligence? The remainder of this blog post will explain.</p>\\n<p>HTM relies on Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs), a form of information\\nrepresentation where you have a long numerical string with mainly 0’s and a few\\n1’s (the degree of sparsity is determined by how few 1’s). In fact, each entry\\nto the pool was an SDR — eleven 1’s and nineteen 0’s. SDRs are the fundamental\\nway our brain represents information. At any point in time, most of the neurons\\nin our brain are quiet and a small percentage of them are firing. We constructed\\nthe Sparse Football Pool to highlight some of the special properties of SDRs. Of\\ncourse, in the brain the numbers are far larger and the situation is more\\ncomplex, but we can illustrate the basic concepts using the Pool.</p>\\n<h4>NUMERICAL PROPERTIES OF SDRS</h4>\\n<p>Even though there are only a small number of 1’s, systems using SDRs can\\nuniquely represent a massive number of patterns. Let’s ask the following\\nquestion: given that you could only select 11 True answers out of 30, how many\\nunique entries are there? The answer is larger than you might guess: there are\\n54,627,300 possible unique entries (we know that sounds like a lot—it’s based on\\na concept called\\n<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficients#Computing_the_value_of_binomial_coefficients\\\">binomial coefficients</a>).\\nIn Numenta’s HTM systems, our patterns typically have 40 bits “on” out of 2,048.\\nThe number of unique patterns is an unimaginably large 2.37 x 10^84!</p>\\n<p>What is the chance someone else would have exactly the same answer as you?\\nAssuming everything is random, that’s just the flip side of the above question:\\none in 54,627,300.</p>\\n<p>What is the chance of someone getting a perfect score? Nine statements out of\\nthe 30 actually came True. Each contestant could select up to 11 statements to\\nbe True, so there was some room for error. Specifically, there are 9,405 answers\\nthat could get the maximum score of 9, so again, if everything was random, the\\nchance of getting a perfect score is about 9,405/54,627,300, or about 1 in\\n5,808. (For more details on the math behind SDRs, see\\n<a href=\\\"/learn/sparse-distributed-representations.html\\\">this talk</a>.)</p>\\n<p>What is a good score? The chance of getting a score of 8 is 1 in 322, and the\\nchance of getting a 7 is 1 in 37. Now, here’s a puzzler: we had less than 100\\nentries yet two people had a score of 8. How is this possible? The fact that a\\nhighly improbable event occurred tells us that something non-random happened,\\nand it relates to the semantic properties, or the meanings, of SDRs.</p>\\n<h4>SEMANTIC PROPERTIES OF SDRS</h4>\\n<p>The world is not random, and neither were the statements. Certain statements\\ncould be grouped into similar semantic categories. If a contestant’s entry was\\ntotally random, then it wouldn’t matter. But, if a contestant had a “point of\\nview”, this thinking would be evident in their entry/SDR.</p>\\n<p>To be sure, the SDRs can represent very specific predictions. If you answered\\nTrue to Statement 8 (Lynch will run for more than 120 yards), then you predicted\\nMarshawn Lynch would do well in a very specific way.</p>\\n<p>But SDRs also can represent more complex concepts. Suppose you answered True to\\nstatements 3, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 23, 25, and 26 (Statement Group 1 below).\\nThese statements are related in meaning; they all predict a wild and exciting\\ngame. If your point of view was that the Super Bowl would be wild and exciting\\nrather than low scoring and boring, your SDR would reflect this meaning. In\\nanother example, if you answered True to statements 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 19, 28, and\\n30 (Statement Group 2 below), you predicted New England was going to dominate\\nSeattle. This SDR reflects another point of view on the game. So, SDRs can\\nrepresent something specific but also can simultaneously convey complex high-\\nlevel information.</p>\\n<p>Put another way, the “distributed” part of SDRs enable the encoding of subtle\\ninformation. Looking again at Group 1 below, you didn’t need to answer True to\\nall the statements for us to know that you thought the game would be exciting –\\neven 3 or 4 Trues from this list would convey your point of view. You conveyed\\nmore subtlety by choosing exactly which ones you answered as True. Even a\\npartial answer tells us something about your thoughts; no particular answer is\\ncritical. This structure is analogous to the brain: a sparse subsampling of\\nactive neurons can represent lots of subtlety and complexity.</p>\\n<p>Finally, SDRs can simultaneously represent multiple independent concepts. If you\\nanswered True to, say, five from the first set, and five from the second set,\\nyou believed both propositions – the game was going to be exciting, but in the\\nend the Patriots were going to beat the Seahawks. The ability to simultaneously\\nrepresent independent concepts is another property of SDRs. It is particularly\\nimportant when you are making predictions. The HTM algorithms and the cortex use\\nthis property to make simultaneous predictions about the future in a single\\nfixed representation.</p>\\n<p>How does this explanation answer the question as to why there were two winners,\\nan extremely unlikely result? Both winners, Donna and Glen, guessed that New\\nEngland would win in a high scoring, exciting game. They had a similar point of\\nview, and they answered True or False to those statements that matched that\\npoint of view. Their guesses weren’t perfect, but they weren’t random. Indeed,\\nif you responded to the statements randomly, you probably didn’t do too well!</p>\\n<p>We have touched on a few properties of SDRs, some of them subtle. You can\\nrepresent semantic properties and concepts. You can represent both very specific\\nand very subtle concepts. You can represent multiple concepts simultaneously,\\nwhich can be used in prediction. The Sparse Football Pool, Numenta’s HTM\\ntechnology, and our brain rely on these same concepts.</p>\\n<p>We hope the Pool helped you understand the power of SDRs and how our brains\\nrepresent information. Most importantly, we hope you had fun with this unusual\\npool!

These sensors provide\\nimportant information in real-time, streaming data. That is, time-series data,\\nwhere there is a natural temporal ordering in the successive measurements made\\nover a time interval.</p>\\n<p>Take a look at Figure 1 below, an example of time-series data from a sensor. The\\nplot shows scalar values over time for an unknown metric. Can you guess if the\\nmetric is blood glucose level for a diabetes patient, stock volume for a Fortune\\n500 company, or something else? It’s difficult to tell, yet it’s apparent the\\nplot shows data anomalies, or deviations from the normal pattern.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/graph1.png\\\" alt=\\\"NAB Screenshot 1\\\"></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> – An example data file from the NAB corpus; data from monitoring\\nthe temperature of an internal component of a large, expensive, industrial\\nmachine. The three blue regions represent anomaly windows, and the purple\\nregion is the detector’s probationary period. For details on these and more\\nNAB components, please explore the\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB/wiki\\\">NAB wiki</a> [1].</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Looking at the entire plot, these anomalies are easily recognized after-the-fact\\nbut identifying anomalies long after they occur isn’t acceptable. Yet many\\nanomaly detection methods run in batch mode, where the data is collected and\\nprocessed after the fact. Real-time data processing, on the other hand, calls\\nfor continual input, process, and output of data. A real-world anomaly detector\\nshould be required to process streaming data, learn continuously, and make\\naccurate detections as soon as possible.</p>\\n<p>At Numenta we’ve built a robust, real-time anomaly detector using\\n<a href=\\\"http://numenta.com/assets/pdf/whitepapers/Numenta%20White%20Paper%20-%20Science%20of%20Anomaly%20Detection.pdf\\\">Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)</a> [2].\\nOur <a href=\\\"http://numenta.com/grok/\\\">Grok application</a> is great demo of the algorithm\\nin action on server metrics data [3]. Other real-time anomaly detectors are\\nout there, namely at\\n<a href=\\\"http://labs.yahoo.com/news/announcing-a-benchmark-dataset-for-time-series-anomaly-detection/\\\">Yahoo</a> and\\n<a href=\\\"https://blog.twitter.com/2015/introducing-practical-and-robust-anomaly-detection-in-a-time-series\\\">Twitter</a>\\nwho both recently announced their activities in real-time anomaly\\ndetection [4], [5]. But how can one truly discern whether or not these\\nalgorithms are up to the task of streaming anomaly detection? Sure HTM does\\ngreat on detecting anomalies in Amazon Web Services metrics with Grok, but what\\nabout the other sensory domains?</p>\\n<p>Enter the <strong>Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)</strong>, an open-source benchmark we’re\\ndeveloping for the evaluation of real-time anomaly detection algorithms. The NAB\\ndataset contains streaming data samples, aiming to capture the difficulties of\\nreal-time anomaly detection, across varying real-world domains. A detector run\\non this dataset is subject to evaluation by the NAB scoring method. To score\\nwell on NAB, anomaly detection algorithms should: run in unsupervised mode,\\nprocess real-time data, learn continuously, reliably detect anomalies, and\\ndetect them as early as possible. Detailed descriptions of all NAB components\\ncan be found in the NAB whitepaper posted in the\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB/wiki\\\">wiki</a> [1]. Figure 2 below shows the\\nNumenta detector on the sample data file of Figure 1, where the algorithm\\naccurately detected all three anomalies with no false positives.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../images/graph2.png\\\" alt=\\\"NAB Screenshot 2\\\"></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> – NAB results for the Numenta detector on a data file\\nrepresenting machine component temperature readings. The detections resulted\\nin all three true positives, and no false positive nor false negatives.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>We’re currently in a “beta” phase, working with a few select companies and\\nresearchers to improve both the benchmark dataset and the scoring methods,\\nbefore submitting the benchmark for publication. Our aim during this phase is to\\ncollaborate with businesses that need real-time anomaly detection and\\nresearchers working on novel algorithms. Part of the value of the benchmark is a\\ndata set consisting of diverse sensory data streams with real labeled anomalies.\\nAs such we’re particularly interested in real-world data files with actual\\nanomalies to add to the dataset.</p>\\n<h4>Call For Participation!</h4>\\n<p>So far we’ve received some great feedback, but there’s still a ways to go. You\\ncan help. Please <a href=\\\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB/\\\">check out NAB</a> for yourself [6].\\nDo you have data to contribute? Great, we’d love to include it in the benchmark,\\nas long as your data meets the following criteria:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Real-world, time-series data</li>\\n<li>Labeled or known anomalies</li>\\n<li>Minimum 1000 records per data file (more would be ideal)</li>\\n<li>Data records must be\\n<ul>\\n<li>from a continuously streaming source</li>\\n<li>in chronological order</li>\\n<li>at roughly equal time intervals</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>Scalar metric(s)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If you have data you might be able to contribute, are interested in the\\nbenchmark, or have questions, please contact us at\\n<a href=\\\"mailto:nab@numenta.org\\\">nab@numenta.org</a>.</p>\\n<p>No real-world anomaly detector is perfect, but which is best?

Choma and Cong propose to\\ntake streaming data from wearable devices, such as the Apple Watch, and use it\\nto improve management of chronic respiratory disease.</p>\\n<p>We selected GDBD for several reasons.  First, the data meets fundamental\\nstreaming requirements; there is a clear streaming data source – a wearable\\nsensor – and the data stream has sufficient velocity.  Second, it seems highly\\nlikely that there will be temporal patterns that can be found by the HTM\\nalgorithms.  Finally, Choma and Cong as a team have both the medical knowledge\\nas well as computer science skills to be able to create an application that\\nmeets the needs of patients and physicians.</p>\\n<p>We congratulate GDBD on their win, and look forward to seeing how their\\napplication evolves.

When we made\\nthe decision to use the GPLv3 license several years ago, the GPL seemed like a\\ngood fit for our needs as we were trying to promote a community that shares\\ntheir work, rather than going with a more permissive style license that allows\\nindividuals to keep enhancements private. The AGPL is in keeping with that\\nspirit and makes clear that use in a\\n<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service\\\">SaaS</a> implementation is\\nalso considered a distribution and thus must fully comply with the GPL. The\\nproposed changes were discussed on our mailing lists and the NuPIC community is\\nsupportive of this change.  Note that the AGPLv3 is explicitly designed to be\\nthe same as the GPLv3 with the additional of the SaaS clarification, and will\\nnot impact open source developers in any other way.</p>\\n<p>Second, we have heard from potential customers that some companies have\\nprohibitions against their engineers using either the GPL or the AGPL.\\nConsequently, we have created a very simple\\n<a href=\\\"http://numenta.org/licenses/trial/\\\">Trial License</a>.  The Trial License confers\\nno commercial rights, but allows research and experimentation with NuPIC\\nsoftware without being required to use an open source license.</p>\\n<p>Finally, as you may know, we have a dual license strategy for NuPIC in that we\\noffer <a href=\\\"http://numenta.org/blog/2013/12/16/nupic-commercial-licenses.html\\\">commercial licenses</a>\\nin addition to our open source license.  Recently, we have had an increase in\\nrequests for commercial licenses to the point where we would like to create a\\nstandard licensing program.  We are in the process of documenting this program\\nto be released in the next few weeks.  We plan on having two types of license,\\none geared towards start-up companies formed specifically to create HTM\\napplications (with no up-front payments and a delayed royalty stream), and the\\nother for established companies.  We hope these will cover the majority of cases\\nbut of course, we can create custom licenses as needed.</p>\\n<p>I believe that these license changes will have a positive impact both for the\\n<a href=\\\"http://numenta.org\\\">NuPIC</a> open source community as well as for potential\\ncommercial partners.  Other than the SaaS change, there is no other change in\\nthe open source license such that researchers, students, and individual\\nprogrammers can continue their work as before.

This ensures the\\nproblem being solved is applicable to HTM, and that the data being analyzed is\\nadequate for HTM. Once a project has been approved, hackers have until\\n<strong>November 6th</strong> to work on it and submit a demo video for judging.</p>\\n<h3>Onsite Event Nov 14</h3>\\n<p><strong>This Challenge can be completed <em>entirely</em> online</strong>, but we encourage you to\\ntry to attend the\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711586/\\\"><strong>Onsite Event</strong></a> that\\nculminates the Challenge on November 14 in Redwood City, California. At this\\nOnsite Event, all demonstration videos will be viewed by a judging panel and a\\nlive audience. Judges will get a chance to comment and ask questions to\\nsubmission authors (either live or over the phone). At the end of the event,\\nwe’ll announce the winners and cash prizes will be awarded!</p>\\n<h4>Sessions</h4>\\n<p>In addition to judging, there will also be at least two educational sessions by\\nNumenta team members <strong>Subutai Ahmad</strong> and <strong>Jeff Hawkins</strong>. They will be\\ntalking about the history and evolution of HTM algorithms and some details about\\nnew algorithm development, respectively.</p>\\n<h5>Temporal Pooling (Jeff Hawkins)</h5>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Temporal pooling is an important aspect of HTM theory. It refers to how\\nrepresentations get more stable as sensory data moves from region to region\\nascending the cortical hierarchy.  It plays an important role in inference,\\nfeedback, and motor control. Our understanding of how temporal works has been\\nrefined a couple of times since the original HTM white paper was published. In\\nthis talk I will review the basic requirements of temporal pooling and introduce\\na new model for temporal pooling, one that is more robust that previous\\nversions. I will also discuss how we think this new temporal pooling model is\\nimplemented in neurons in the neocortex.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h5>Temporal Memory of HTM: A Retrospective (Subutai Ahmad)</h5>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Did you realize that the development of HTM algorithms at Numenta has been\\ngoing on for over 10 years? Subutai (who has seen it all) will step you through\\nthe sequence of HTM developments, from our very first demos, algorithms and\\nproducts, to our current research on cortical algorithms.

You\\ncan see them all here:</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/submissions\\\">http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/submissions</a></p>\\n<p>It’s interesting to note that the #1 and #2 winners are both in the field of\\ntransportation, one detecting car traffic anomalies and the other relative to\\naviation anomalies, both using our geospatial encoder.</p>\\n<p>To me, however, the most notable result of the contest was to realize the\\nbreadth of the type of applications that can be addressed with HTM.  Although\\nthese were just demonstration programs, not ready for commercialization, they\\noffer support to the notion of a generalized machine intelligence approach.\\nWhether the application was predicting traffic, tracking heart monitors,\\nunderstanding natural language, or generating music, the exact same algorithm is\\nat play, just like in your brain.</p>\\n<p>We often talk about how our biologically derived technology is extremely\\nflexible and applicable to many different problems. It’s nice to see this\\nreinforced with the wide variety of submissions. Thank you to everyone who\\nparticipated in this challenge.

This\\ntask is made difficult by the fact that there is not an agreed vocabulary;\\neverybody uses the above terms (and other associated terms) differently.  In\\naddition, the commonly understood meaning of some of these terms has evolved\\nover time.  What was meant by AI in 1960 is very different than what is meant\\ntoday.</p>\\n<p>In our view, there are three major approaches to building smart machines.  Let’s\\ncall these approaches <em>Classic AI</em>, <em>Simple Neural Networks</em>, and <em>Biological\\nNeural Networks</em>.  The rest of this blog post will describe and differentiate\\nthese approaches.  At the end, we’ll include an example as to how each approach\\nmight address the same problem.  This analysis is intended for a business rather\\nthan technical audience, so we simplify somewhat and thus beg the indulgence of\\ntechnical experts who might quibble with the details.</p>\\n<h3><em>Classic AI</em> Approach</h3>\\n<p>The earliest approaches to AI were computer programs designed to solve problems\\nthat human brains performed easily, such as understanding text or recognizing\\nobjects in an image. Results of this work were disappointing and progress was\\nslow.  For many problems, researchers concluded that a computer had to have\\naccess to large amounts of knowledge in order to be “smart”.  Thus they\\nintroduced “expert systems”, computer programs combined with rules provided by\\ndomain experts to solve problems, such as medical diagnoses, by asking a series\\nof questions.  If the disease was not properly diagnosed, the expert adds\\nadditional questions/rules to narrow the diagnosis.  A <em>Classic AI</em> system is\\nhighly tuned for a specific problem.</p>\\n<p>IBM’s Watson could be viewed as a modern version of a <em>Classic AI</em> system.  It\\nfocuses on creating a sophisticated knowledge base on a particular issue.\\nAlthough Watson doesn’t rely on encoded rules, it requires the close involvement\\nof domain experts to provide data and evaluate its performance.  <em>Classic AI</em>\\nhas solved some clearly defined problems but is limited by its inability to\\nlearn on its own and by the need to create specific solutions to individual\\nproblems.  In this regard, in spite of it being called artificial intelligence,\\nit has very little in common with general human intelligence.</p>\\n<h3><em>Simple Neural Network</em> Approach</h3>\\n<p>Some early researchers explored the idea of neuron models for artificial\\nintelligence. When the limits of <em>Classic AI</em> became clear, this notion picked\\nup steam and with the addition of back propagation techniques, started proving\\nuseful. The resulting technology, artificial neural networks (ANNs), was created\\nover 50 years ago when very little was known about how real neurons worked.\\nSince then, neuroscientists have learned a great deal about neural anatomy and\\nphysiology, but the basic design of ANNs has changed very little. Therefore,\\ndespite the name neural networks, the design of ANNs has little in common with\\nreal neurons.  Instead, the emphasis of ANNs moved from biological realism to\\nthe desire to learn from data without human supervision. Consequently, the big\\nadvantage of <em>Simple Neural Networks</em> over <em>Classic AI</em> is that they learn from\\ndata and don’t require an expert to provide rules.  Today ANNs are part of a\\nbroader category called “machine learning” which includes other mathematical and\\nstatistical techniques. Machine learning techniques, including ANNs, look at\\nlarge bodies of data, extract statistics, and classify the results.</p>\\n<p>ANNs have recently evolved into Deep Learning networks, whose advances have been\\nenabled by access to fast computers and vast amounts of data for training.  Deep\\nLearning has successfully addressed many problems such as image classification,\\nlanguage translation and identifying spam in email.</p>\\n<p>Although Simple Neural Network systems can solve many problems that were not\\nsolvable using <em>Classic AI</em>, they have limitations.  For example, they don’t\\nwork well when there is limited data for training, and they don’t handle\\nproblems where the patterns in the data are constantly changing. Essentially,\\nthe Simple Neural Network approach is a sophisticated mathematical technique\\nthat finds patterns in large, static data sets.</p>\\n<p>There is a deeper and more important issue beyond the current limitations of\\n<em>Classic AI</em> and of <em>Simple Neural Networks</em>. In our view, both of these\\napproaches are not on a path to achieve true machine intelligence; they don’t\\nprovide a roadmap to get there, which brings us to the third approach.</p>\\n<h3><em>Biological Neural Network</em> Approach</h3>\\n<p>Everyone agrees that the human brain is an intelligent system; in fact it is the\\nonly system everyone agrees is intelligent.  We believe that by studying how the\\nbrain works we can learn what intelligence is and what properties of the brain\\nare essential for any intelligent system. For example we know the brain\\nrepresents information using sparse distributed representations (SDRs), which\\nare essential for semantic generalization and creativity. We are confident that\\nall truly intelligent machines will be based on SDRs. SDRs are not something\\nthat can be added to existing machine learning techniques; they are more like a\\nfoundation upon which everything else depends. Other essential attributes\\ninclude that memory is primarily a sequences of patterns, that behavior is an\\nessential part of all learning, and that learning must be continuous.  In\\naddition, we now know that biological neurons are far more sophisticated than\\nthe simple neurons used in the Simple Neural Network approach – and the\\ndifferences matter. We believe you can’t get to machine intelligence by\\nincrementally building upon the simple neuron approach, but instead must throw\\nit away and start over with a more realistic biological approach.</p>\\n<p>Numenta’s technology, Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), is the best example of\\nthe <em>Biological Neural Network</em> approach.  Today, HTM systems are able to learn\\nthe structure of streaming data, make predictions and detect anomalies. They\\nlearn continuously from unlabeled data. By taking a robust biological approach,\\nthe brain gives us a roadmap of where to direct our work in the future, such as\\ncompleting our understanding of behavior, attention and short term memory.  This\\nroadmap distinguishes HTM from other techniques and makes it the best candidate\\nfor creating intelligent machines.</p>\\n<h3>An Example</h3>\\n<p>Let’s take a problem and think about how it might be addressed in the three\\ndifferent approaches.  Again, we oversimplify a bit in order to distinguish the\\nmain differences of the three approaches.</p>\\n<p>We have been asked to detect rogue behavior of an employee within an\\norganization.  For example, companies with confidential information want to know\\nif people with internal access are abusing that information.  A change in\\nemployee behavior might be totally legitimate – the employee has changed roles,\\nand now has new responsibilities – or it could be a problem.</p>\\n<p>Rogue behavior is difficult to identify.  The <em>Classic AI</em> approach would\\naddress this problem with a series of rules.  For example, let’s consider an\\nanalyst who works with confidential customer data.  The <em>Classic AI</em> system\\nwould need a human to figure out likely problem scenarios then program the\\nsystem to look for those scenarios.  This solution might flag any instance where\\nthe analyst has accessed the customer file more than 10 times in the month.  As\\nthe <em>Classic AI</em> system is deployed, and false positives and false negatives are\\nexamined, the rules would be strengthened.  The new rule might say that an\\nanalyst accessing customer data in the first few days of the month is not\\nflagged, but it is for the remainder of the month.</p>\\n<p>The <em>Simple Neural Network</em> approach would start with lots of historical data,\\nnamely a large database of known problem scenarios.  The <em>Simple Neuron Network</em>\\nsystem might figure out, for example, that abuse of this information only\\nhappens in the last week of the month.  The system identifies such features and\\nthen classifies an individual as “unusual” or “not unusual”.  Although it sounds\\nsimilar to the <em>Classic AI</em> approach, in this case, the features are learned\\nfrom the data, not from an expert.</p>\\n<p>Both approaches have some problems.  With the <em>Classic AI</em> solution you need to\\nknow what you are looking for.  But criminals constantly change strategies to\\navoid detection and the rules don’t adapt. The <em>Simple Neural Network</em> approach\\nrequires a lot of labeled data to be able to find common features, but this kind\\nof data generally doesn’t exist for unusual behavior.  Both approaches are\\nunsuitable for modeling individual behaviors and require the system to be\\nretrained when new patterns arise.</p>\\n<p>The <em>Biological Neural Network</em> approach would stream the data from each analyst\\n(such as the details of the files routinely accessed, numbers of emails, numbers\\nof postings, etc.) and would automatically build individual models of normal\\nbehavior for each person.  The system would then predict what would be normal\\nfor each analyst and would flag anything abnormal.  One could stream a lot of\\ndifferent metrics without knowing which will be important – all the modeling is\\nautomated.  The <em>Biological Neural Network</em> system does not need to know what it\\nis looking for, can model each individual separately, and continuously learns as\\ndata changes.</p>\\n<p>In summary, below are the characteristics of the three different approaches:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th><em>Classic AI</em></th>\\n<th><em>Simple Neural Network</em></th>\\n<th><em>Biological Neural Network</em></th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Examples</td>\\n<td>Watson</td>\\n<td>Deep Learning</td>\\n<td>Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Associated terms</td>\\n<td>Expert systems</td>\\n<td>Artificial Neural Nets (ANN) <br/> Machine learning</td>\\n<td>Machine intelligence</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Data sources</td>\\n<td>Rules from experts</td>\\n<td>Large datasets</td>\\n<td>Data streams</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Training</td>\\n<td>Programmed by experts</td>\\n<td>Derived from labeled databases</td>\\n<td>Derived from unlabeled data streams</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Outputs</td>\\n<td>Answers to questions</td>\\n<td>Classification</td>\\n<td>Prediction <br/> Anomaly detection <br/> Classification</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Batch vs. continuous learning</td>\\n<td>Batch</td>\\n<td>Batch</td>\\n<td>Continuous</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Need to know what you are looking for</td>\\n<td>Yes</td>\\n<td>Requires labeled data</td>\\n<td>No</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Many individual models</td>\\n<td>Hard</td>\\n<td>Hard</td>\\n<td>Easy</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Biological basis</td>\\n<td>None</td>\\n<td>Simple</td>\\n<td>Realistic</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Provides roadmap to machine intelligence</td>\\n<td>No</td>\\n<td>No</td>\\n<td>Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Summary</h3>\\n<p>We return to the question of terminology that we started this post with.  Our\\nfeeling is that the term “artificial intelligence” has been used in so many ways\\nthat it is now confusing.  People use AI to refer to all three approaches\\ndescribed above, plus others, and therefore has become almost meaningless.  The\\nterm “machine learning” is a more narrowly defined term for machines that learn\\nfrom data, including simple neural models such as ANNs and Deep Learning.  We\\nuse the term “machine intelligence” to refer to machines that learn but are\\naligned with the <em>Biological Neural Network</em> approach.  Although there still is\\nmuch work ahead of us, we believe the <em>Biological Neural Network</em> approach is\\nthe fastest and most direct path to truly intelligent machines.</p>\\n<p><em>This blog entry was modified on Thu Mar 24 2016 to clarify the timing of neural\\nnetwork research.</em></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2016/01/11/machine-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-artificial-intelligence.md\n ** module id = 866\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Christy Maver\",\"brief\":\"This morning, as Hollywood anxiously awaited to hear the nominees for this year’s Academy Awards, another set of winners was recognized – not for motion pictures, but for artificial intelligence.\",\"date\":\"2016/01/14\",\"featured\":false,\"image\":\"../images/image.png\",\"org\":\"Director of Marketing\",\"tags\":\"numenta AI awards artificial machine intelligence learning deep htm brain neurons nupic\",\"title\":\"And the award goes to\",\"body\":\"<h2>type: post</h2>\\n<p>This morning, as Hollywood anxiously awaited to hear the nominees for this\\nyear’s Academy Awards, another set of winners was recognized – not for motion\\npictures, but for artificial intelligence. <a href=\\\"http://awards.ai/\\\">The Global Annual Achievement Awards\\nfor Artificial Intelligence</a> were announced today by\\n<a href=\\\"http://Awards.AI\\\">http://Awards.AI</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://Awards.AI\\\">Awards.AI</a> is part of the <a href=\\\"http://informed.ai/\\\">Informed.AI Network</a>, which\\nprovides a range of information resources for Artificial Intelligence and\\nMachine Learning.

Rather than try to create 600 individual\\nmodels and learn patterns in each one, you might set global thresholds like,\\n“Notify me when any stock price moves more than 1 standard deviation away from\\nits moving average of the last 60 days.” You would catch some anomalies this\\nway, but you would miss the more subtle temporal anomalies.</p>\\n<p>A couple recent examples demonstrate how HTM for Stocks finds these types of\\nanomalies:</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h4>Example #1</h4>\\n<p>On February 17, HTM for Stocks found a purely temporal anomaly in the stock\\nvolume of FCX (Freeport-McMoRan).  It is normal for stock volume to spike at the\\nbeginning and end of a trading day, with the data often resembling a U shape.\\nHowever, it’s very rare for a stock’s volume to spike twice in a short time\\nframe.  HTM for Stocks catches this anomaly, where other detection methods like\\nthresholding would not.</p>\\n<div>\\n  <img src=\\\"../images/2.png\\\" class=\\\"center-block img-responsive media-border\\\" alt=\\\"HTM for Stocks screenshot\\\" />\\n</div>\\n<p>Interestingly, HTM for Stocks identifies temporal anomalies in the Twitter\\nvolume just before the stock volume anomaly.</p>\\n<div>\\n  <img src=\\\"../images/3.png\\\" class=\\\"center-block img-responsive media-border\\\" alt=\\\"HTM for Stocks screenshot\\\" />\\n</div>\\n<p>The Twitter volume data not only indicates that something unusual is happening\\nwith this stock, it also serves as root cause analysis.  You can view the\\nunderlying Twitter data by tapping on it to reveal the tweets.  This allows you\\nto get qualitative insights and see what people are saying about the company’s\\nstock.  In this case, many of the tweets were advising shareholders to sell this\\nparticular stock if it go to a certain price.</p>\\n<h4>Example #2</h4>\\n<p>On February 4, HTM for Stocks picked up an unusually high volume of Twitter\\nactivity for Conoco Phillips before the market opened. The company had announced\\na large decrease in dividends. This was followed by anomalous stock volume\\nmovement where again we see a double spike at the beginning of market hours.\\nWe also see multiple Twitter volume anomalies throughout the day.</p>\\n<div>\\n  <img src=\\\"../images/4.png\\\" class=\\\"center-block img-responsive media-border\\\" alt=\\\"HTM for Stocks screenshot\\\" />\\n</div>\\n<p>Much like the previous example, these anomalies are temporal in nature, and\\nwould not necessarily be caught using a global alert or thresholding technique.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>HTM for Stocks demonstrates the value of combining multiple metrics.  If you\\nwere only monitoring any one of these 3 streams (stock price, volume and Twitter\\nvolume), you might miss some important anomalies.  But if two or three data\\nstreams are displaying unusual behavior at the same time, something truly\\nsignificant is happening.</p>\\n<p>Numenta has no plans to turn this into a commercial application, but it’s easy\\nto see how someone could.  The amount of data we are faced with in a single day\\ncontinues to grow while the amount of hours in a day never will. The underlying\\ntechnology is not specific to stocks but can be applied to many different\\nstreaming applications. The ability to do anomaly detection in streaming\\nanalytics with large, noisy data streams offer real-time insights and a\\ncompetitive advantage.</p>\\n<p>I hope you’ll download HTM for Stocks and give it a try.

Why does a machine intelligence company attend a\\nneuroscience meeting? Numenta’s approach to machine intelligence starts with a\\ndeep understanding of how the neocortex learns. We use the brain as a blueprint.\\nThe HTM theory is not only inspired by neuroscience concepts, but also\\nconstrained by detailed neuroscience findings. Neuroscientists, using many new\\ntools, have made tremendous advancements in understanding the physiology and\\nconnectivity of the brain. We would like to see whether the latest experimental\\nevidences could fit into the HTM theory. If not, how should we revise the theory\\nto be consistent with the experimental observations?</p>\\n<h3>From neuroscience findings to machine intelligence</h3>\\n<p>This year we presented a poster on “a theory of sequence memory in the\\nneocortex.” The ability to recognize and memorize regular temporal patterns from\\nsensory input streams is critical for almost all cortical functions. The topic\\nof neural representations of time and sequence in the cortex was very popular at\\nCosyne this year, as you can see in the\\n<a href=\\\"http://cosyne.org/cosyne16/Cosyne2016_program_book.pdf\\\">program guide</a>.\\nOur work is unique, as it is not only built on concrete experimental findings\\nfrom neuroscience and makes a number of experimentally testable predictions, but\\nalso achieves compelling performance on real-world sequence learning tasks.</p>\\n<p>Neurons in the neocortex receive thousands of inputs on their highly elaborated\\ndendritic trees. Unlike most artificial neural network models individual\\ndendritic branches act as active pattern detectors: co-activation of a number of\\nsynapses leads to a dendritic spike that can depolarize the cell body for\\nhundreds of milliseconds. This phenomenon of active dendrites has been known for\\na long time among neuroscientists. A number of presentations at Cosyne modeled\\nthe biophysical mechanism underlying dendritic spikes. Nevertheless, the\\nfunction of dendritic spikes remains unclear and it is not incorporated in most\\nneural network models.</p>\\n<img src=\\\"../images/2.png\\\" class=\\\"center-block img-responsive media-border\\\" alt=\\\"Image of Active Dendrite Firing Timing\\\" />\\n<div class=\\\"caption\\\">\\n  **Left:** A pyramidal neuron in the cortex (Spruston 2008, Nat Rev Neurosci).\\n  <br/>\\n  **Right:** Researchers stimulated individual synapses optically and measured\\n  voltage responses at the soma. Simultaneous stimulation of enough synapses\\n  (8 in this case) caused a large and sustained depolarization at the cell body\\n  (Major et al., 2013, Annu Rev Neurosci).\\n</div>\\n<p>The HTM sequence memory model utilizes the active dendrites of cortical neurons\\nto learn sequences from data streams. Temporal sequences are learned via growth\\nof new synapses and are represented with\\n<a href=\\\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07469\\\">sparse distributed representations</a>.\\nPredictions of future inputs are made through the generation of dendritic\\nspikes. The resulting model gives rise to a powerful sequence memory, which not\\nonly achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art machine learning\\nalgorithms, but also exhibits many desirable attributes for real-world sequence\\nlearning with streaming data.</p>\\n<img src=\\\"../images/3.png\\\" class=\\\"center-block img-responsive media-border\\\" alt=\\\"Prediction graph image\\\" />\\n<div class=\\\"caption\\\">\\n  HTM sequence memory model makes accurate 2.5 hour ahead-predictions of taxi\\n  demand in the New York City.\\n</div>\\n<h3>Interactions with other neuroscientists</h3>\\n<p>Our work attracted wide interest among\\nneuroscientists. Several experimental neuroscientists were very excited to learn\\nabout the important functional role of the long observed phenomena of dendritic\\nspikes. Some even expressed interest in running more specific experiments to\\ntest the learning mechanisms used in HTM. We also benefited by discussing with\\nother neuroscientists. For example, by talking with researchers that build\\ndetailed biophysical models of active dendrites, we now have a better idea of\\nhow HTM would work on a detailed biophysical level.</p>\\n<p>I found quite a few other presentations at Cosyne that were related to HTM.\\nProf. Michael Berry’s group from Princeton University recorded a large\\npopulation of neurons in the primary visual cortex during the presentation of\\nimage sequences. The observed behavior of the real neural population matches\\nmany aspects of the HTM sequence memory model.  Prof. Jose Carmena from UC\\nBerkeley presented a novel paradigm for brain-machine interface where subjects\\ncontinuously learn to control a small set of neurons. Interestingly, the\\nperformance over time looks quite similar to that of the HTM model on a\\ncontinuous learning task. These studies, and many others, give us valuable\\ninsights on the development of future HTM algorithms. We would like to keep\\ncollaborating with the neuroscience community. We believe doing so would\\ntremendously speed up our progress on machine intelligence.</p>\\n<p>I encourage you to take a look at our poster and the\\n<a href=\\\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05463\\\">accompanying paper</a>.

The field of neuroscience is trying to understand\\nthe computational properties of the brain. If we think current neuroscience\\ntechniques are sufficient to understand something as complex as the brain,\\nsurely they will be able to handle a small microprocessor. If, on the other\\nhand, current techniques are insufficient to understand even this simple CPU, it\\nraises serious questions about the current approaches in the field. True, the\\nbrain is not a silicon processor but there are similarities (they list several\\nin the paper). So let’s apply these techniques to this simpler computational\\nsystem as a litmus test.</p>\\n<p>Their methodology includes applying an array of traditional techniques such as\\nlesioning, examining statistics of bit patterns, analyzing tuning properties of\\ntransistors, dimensionality reduction, etc. They studied the microprocessor “in\\nvivo” while playing a variety of video games (you can tell they had a lot of fun\\nwith this project!) They were able to discover that transistors exhibited very\\nlow pairwise correlations but were not actually independent (very similar to\\nbehavior of neurons<sup><a href=\\\"#3\\\">[3]</a></sup>). They showed strong spatiotemporal\\nstructure in the activity of various processor components. The resulting plots\\nand charts look remarkably similar to those in neuroscience papers. Yet these\\ntechniques did not uncover the true computational nature of the microprocessor\\nnor its functional structure.</p>\\n<p>Of course, in this process what they are really asking is “Could a\\nneuroscientist understand the brain”?<sup><a href=\\\"#4\\\">[4]</a></sup> Their conclusion: an\\nunequivocal “NO”.</p>\\n<p>We all know that “correlation does not imply causation”. Current statistical\\ntechniques report all sorts of correlations, but little regarding true\\nunderlying structure.</p>\\n<h3>What does it mean to understand the brain?</h3>\\n<p>So what does it really mean to understand the brain? Unfortunately the paper\\ndoes not answer this question. They do make vague comments that the field should\\nunderstand “how the output relates to the inputs”, and that it should reward\\n&quot;those who innovate methodologically.&quot; These statements are unsatisfactory at\\nbest.</p>\\n<p>I propose a much stronger answer. As a computer scientist, I believe the only\\nway to be certain you understand something is to build it. Write the program for\\nit. We don’t need to create an exact replica, just a system that demonstrates\\nthe important properties.  This methodology is harder but demands that you\\nuncover underlying structure and function.</p>\\n<p>Let me give an analogy using a different paradigm. Suppose cars didn’t exist.\\nHumans somehow get access to a luxury Mercedes sedan and the race is on to\\nunderstand how it works.  Let’s consider two alternative approaches.</p>\\n<p>The first approach involves calculating a number of statistical measures and\\nbuilding predictive models. These models might accurately predict the car’s gas\\nmileage under different conditions, such as going uphill vs downhill. They might\\nbe able to plot precise acceleration profiles under different loads.  They would\\nknow exactly how long it takes the air conditioning to cool the car in different\\nclimates. Scientists would publish thousands of peer-reviewed papers with all\\nsorts of equations and charts proving the accuracy of these models. But would\\nthey really understand how the car works?</p>\\n<p>The second approach involves using the car to deduce fundamental mechanisms such\\nas a power source, transmission, and steering. It would focus on the function of\\nthese subsystems, and less on details such as the strength of bolts or the\\nefficiency of water pumps. To test our theories of function we would build a\\nmuch simpler machine from scratch, perhaps something like a Ford\\nModel T<sup><a href=\\\"#5\\\">[5]</a></sup>. This car would have a super simple engine and hand\\ncranked starter. The controls might be awkward, the tires bad, and the seats\\nuncomfortable. It would definitely have no air conditioning. It might not even\\nbe as fast as a horse! But, you could actually drive this car. Because we\\nunderstand how our simple car works, over time we can improve it and eventually\\nbuild vehicles even better than the Mercedes prototype.</p>\\n<h3>What is our approach?</h3>\\n<p>At Numenta we are using this second approach to understanding the brain.  We are\\nbuilding the Model T equivalent of the neocortex.</p>\\n<p>We use neuroscience discoveries and details to deduce the fundamental components\\nof intelligence. For example, we know that the neocortex learns a predictive\\nmodel of the world. It learns continuously without supervision. We know that\\nbehavior and sensory inference are not separate processes, but are intimately\\nintegrated such that learning cannot be achieved without behavior. Our theories\\nare constrained by and consistent with a great many neurosciences details, but\\nour software simulations only capture the functional properties of the brain and\\nnot all the details.  We are often asked, “How do you decide what neuroscience\\ndetails to include in your simulations and which to leave out?”  The answer is\\nwe include neuroscience details when they are essential for function. When we\\nhit stumbling blocks we return to experimental neuroscience to provide clues and\\nhard constraints on how to solve problems. Our simulations also provide insights\\ninto the structure of cortex<sup><a href=\\\"#6\\\">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href=\\\"#7\\\">[7]</a></sup>.</p>\\n<p>Compared to the brain, our software is at an early stage and primitive, like a\\nModel T. But, you can actually take it for a spin, see how it performs, and then\\nknow what areas need improvement.</p>\\n<p>Can we understand the brain? We have made excellent progress with our approach.\\nIf we stay focused on large-scale functional theories and building systems based\\non those theories, the answer to this question is an unequivocal “YES”!</p>\\n<h3>Footnotes and Citations</h3>\\n<p><span id=\\\"1\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"></span>\\n<strong>[1]</strong> Jonas, E., and Kording, K.

Every\\nserver, every building, and every device generates a continuous stream of\\ninformation that is ever changing and potentially valuable. The existing big\\ndata paradigm requires storing data for batch analysis, and extensive modeling\\nby a human expert, prior to deployment. This is incredibly inefficient and\\ncannot scale. Instead there is a growing need to rapidly create adaptive models\\nthat accept streaming data sources and can take instant action.</p>\\n<p>In this talk I will describe a new paradigm for streaming data algorithms, based\\non recent neuroscience findings and on the computational properties of the\\nneocortex.  These systems are highly automated, adapt to changing statistics,\\nand naturally deal with temporal data streams. They require no batch training\\nand custom models can be deployed on the fly.  Many of the core ideas have been\\nimplemented in the open source project NuPIC, and validated in commercial\\napplications.  Given the massive increase in the number of data sources, a\\ngeneral-purpose automated approach is the only scalable way to effectively\\nanalyze and act on continuously streaming information.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./events/2015/02/17/strata-hadoop-world.md\n ** module id = 936\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"9fc8aa6362ee4eba6e5e51f57a0c313e.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./events/2015/02/23/images/image.png\n ** module id = 937\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Jeff Hawkins\",\"brief\":null,\"date\":\"2015/02/23\",\"event\":{\"when\":{\"begin\":\"2015/02/23\",\"end\":\"2015/02/25\"},\"where\":{\"desc\":\"Hyatt Regency Tamaya\",\"city\":\"Santa Ana Pueblo\",\"state\":\"NM\",\"country\":\"USA\",\"web\":\"http://nice.sandia.gov/\"},\"who\":\"Jeff Hawkins\",\"why\":\"Speaking\"},\"featured\":false,\"image\":\"../images/image.png\",\"org\":\"Co-Founder\",\"tags\":\"numenta jeff hawkins speaking sandia national laboratories neuro inspired computational elements workshop 2015\",\"title\":\"Sandia National Laboratories Neuro-Inspired Computational Elements Workshop 2015\",\"type\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<h3>Sandia National Laboratories</h3>\\n<p><strong>Neuro-Inspired Computational Elements Workshop 2015</strong></p>\\n<h3>Video Links</h3>\\n<p>Click link title to play.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://digitalops.sandia.gov/Mediasite/Play/515d11e3d7404d608c3b50ba4e8496981d\\\">Reverse Engineering the Neocortex (49:00)</a>,\\nJeff Hawkins, Numenta.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://digitalops.sandia.gov/Mediasite/Play/1365ba62685c4c91a1cb7143c1e321cc1d\\\">IBM Cortical Learning Center (33:18)</a>,\\nWinfried Wilcke, IBM CLC.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Abstract</h3>\\n<p><strong>Beyond von Neumann/Turing Architecture and Moore’s Law Limits</strong></p>\\n<p>Conventional, stored program architecture systems are designed for algorithmic\\nand exact calculations.

Despite these rapid\\nsensory changes, our perception of the world is amazingly stable, and we can\\nreliably discriminate between different patterns. This suggests that we learn\\nstable but distinct representations through active exploration. There is reason\\nto believe that efference copy, an internal copy of the motor signal, is\\ncritical for such sensorimotor learning. However the exact brain mechanisms\\nunderlying these computations remain unknown. In this study, we propose a\\ncomputational model of sensorimotor learning and prediction. Sparse distributed\\nrepresentations of visual scenes are built up incrementally by pooling together\\npredictable temporal transitions during exploration. To enable accurate\\npredictions during active exploration, we modified the Hierarchical Temporal\\nMemory sequence-learning algorithm to use both sensory inputs and efference copy\\nsignals. To enable forming stable representations of scenes, we implemented a\\nnovel temporal pooling learning rule that allows downstream neurons to form\\nconnections with upstream neurons that are predicting correctly.</p>\\n<p>The overall model is unsupervised and the architecture is consistent with\\nseveral important aspects of thalamocortical circuits. We tested the algorithm\\non a set of simulated environments, as well as a robotics test bed. In both\\ncases the model achieves two desired properties: 1) prediction of future sensory\\ninputs during behavior, and 2) emergence of stable and distinct representations\\nfor learned patterns. After learning, the sparse activity of cells in downstream\\nregions is stable despite sensor movements, while different images lead to\\ndistinct representations. These results demonstrate how efference copy can be\\nused in sensory cortex to make predictions during behavior. We propose temporal\\npooling as a novel computational principle for forming invariant representations\\nduring unsupervised learning and active exploration.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./events/2015/03/05/cosyne-computational-systems-neuroscience-2015.md\n ** module id = 939\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"669d4294c03eb1aeda3d8e2a2032fc17.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./events/2015/03/05/images/image.png\n ** module id = 940\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"96ea273775426b06230a610474000d09.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./events/2015/03/05/images/image@2x.png\n ** module id = 941\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"607c167c3e2c10106fb5c0d5581caedf.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./events/2015/03/17/images/image.png\n ** module id = 942\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"f063db3a2cb0865dd7ec220f5ef063a2.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./events/2015/03/17/images/image@2x.png\n ** module id = 943\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Jeff Hawkins\",\"brief\":null,\"date\":\"2015/03/17\",\"event\":{\"what\":\"What the Brain Says About Machine Intelligence\",\"when\":{\"begin\":\"2015/03/17 19:00\",\"end\":\"2015/03/17 21:00\"},\"where\":{\"desc\":\"Cornell Tech\",\"city\":\"New York\",\"state\":\"NY\",\"country\":\"USA\",\"web\":\"http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/220895892/\"},\"who\":\"Jeff Hawkins\",\"why\":\"Speaking\"},\"featured\":false,\"image\":\"../images/image.png\",\"org\":\"Co-Founder\",\"tags\":\"meetup nyc new york city cornell tech what the brain says about machine intelligence jeff hawkins numenta\",\"title\":\"What the Brain Says About Machine Intelligence NYC Meetup\",\"type\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<h3>Summary</h3>\\n<p>Come hear Jeff Hawkins speak about the machine intelligence work being done at\\nNumenta in NYC.

I will describe the progress we are making in understanding how the\\nneocortex works and demonstrate how we are turning that knowledge into useful\\ntechnology and products.</p>\\n<h3>Biography</h3>\\n<p>Jeff Hawkins is an engineer, serial entrepreneur, scientist, inventor, and\\nauthor. He was a founder of two mobile computing companies, Palm and Handspring,\\nand was the architect of many computing products such as the PalmPilot and Treo\\nsmartphone. Throughout his life Jeff has also had a deep interest in\\nneuroscience and theories of the neocortex. In 2002 he founded the Redwood\\nNeuroscience Institute, a scientific institute focused on understanding how the\\nneocortex processes information. The institute is now located at U.C. Berkeley.\\nIn 2004 he wrote the book On Intelligence, which describes progress on\\nunderstanding the neocortex. In 2005 he co-founded Numenta, a startup company\\nbuilding a technology based on neocortical theory. It is his hope that Numenta\\nwill play a catalytic role in the emerging field of machine intelligence. Jeff\\nHawkins earned his B.S. in electrical engineering from Cornell University\\nin 1979.

Every\\nserver, every building, and every device generates a continuous stream of\\ninformation that is ever changing and potentially valuable. The existing big\\ndata paradigm requires storing data for batch analysis, and extensive modeling\\nby a human expert, prior to deployment. This is incredibly inefficient and\\ncannot scale. Instead there is a growing need to rapidly create adaptive\\nmodels that accept streaming data sources and can take instant action.</p>\\n<p>In this talk I will describe a new paradigm for streaming data algorithms,\\nbased on recent neuroscience findings and on the computational properties of\\nthe neocortex. These systems are highly automated, adapt to changing\\nstatistics, and naturally deal with temporal data streams. They require no\\nbatch training and custom models can be deployed on the fly. Many of the core\\nideas have been implemented in the open source project NuPIC, and validated in\\ncommercial applications. Given the massive increase in the number of data\\nsources, a general-purpose automated approach is the only scalable way to\\neffectively analyze and act on continuously streaming information.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Subutai Ahmad is the VP of Research at Numenta, a company focused on Machine\\nIntelligence. Our technology, Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), is a detailed\\ncomputational framework based on principles of the brain. Our HTM learning\\nalgorithms are available through the NuPIC open source community and are\\nembedded in our commercial streaming analytics applications.</p>\\n<p>Subutai’s experience includes computational neuroscience, machine learning,\\ncomputer vision and building real time commercial systems. He has previously\\nserved as VP Engineering at YesVideo where he helped grow the company from a\\nthree-person start-up to a leader in automated digital media authoring.

We then propose a neuron model\\nwhere some of the patterns recognized by a neuron lead to action potentials and\\ndefine the classic receptive field of the neuron, whereas the majority of the\\npatterns recognized by a neuron act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the\\nneuron without immediately generating an action potential. We then present a\\nnetwork model based on neurons with these properties and show that the network\\nlearns a robust model of time-based sequences. Given the similarity of\\nexcitatory neurons throughout the neocortex and the importance of sequence\\nmemory in inference and behavior, we propose that this form of sequence memory\\nis a universal property of neocortical tissue. We further propose that cellular\\nlayers in the neocortex implement variations of the same sequence memory\\nalgorithm to achieve different aspects of inference and behavior. The neuron and\\nnetwork models we introduce are robust over a wide range of parameters as long\\nas the network uses a sparse distributed code of cellular activations. The\\nsequence capacity of the network scales linearly with the number of synapses on\\neach neuron. Thus neurons need thousands of synapses to learn the many temporal\\npatterns in sensory stimuli and motor sequences.</p>\\n<p>Related links:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://numenta.com/learn/why-neurons-have-thousands-of-synapses-theory-of-sequence-memory-in-neocortex.html\\\">Blog Post</a></li>\\n<li><t render=\\\"hbs\\\"><a href=\\\"%7B%7Bsite.paths.ext.paper.sequence%7D%7D\\\">PDF Whitepaper</a></t></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>About Cosyne</h4>\\n<p>The annual Cosyne meeting provides an inclusive forum for the exchange of\\nexperimental and theoretical/computational approaches to problems in systems\\nneuroscience.</p>\\n<p>To encourage interdisciplinary interactions, the main meeting is arranged in a\\nsingle track.

Largely driven by the rise of the Internet of\\nThings (IoT) and connected real-time data sources, we now have an enormous\\nnumber of applications with sensors that produce important data that changes\\nover time. This data presents a challenge and opportunity for businesses across\\nevery industry. How do they handle the onslaught of streaming data? How can they\\nexploit it to make decisions in real-time? One way is to detect, in real time,\\nwhen something unusual occurs. Early anomaly detection in streaming data has\\nsignificant implications, yet can be very difficult to execute. It requires\\ndetectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while\\nsimultaneously making predictions. In this talk, we’ll look at algorithms\\ndesigned for such data and analyze the components that lead to optimal\\nperformance. We’ll also discuss a new benchmark with a labeled, real-world data\\nset, designed to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source\\ntools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data.

Algorithms must be able to\\nlearn and predict online, in real-time. They also must continuously learn and\\nadapt to changing statistics of the environment while simultaneously making\\npredictions.</p>\\n<p>At Numenta we’ve developed Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a theory of\\nneocortex implemented in software for machine learning applications. HTM runs\\nonline and unsupervised, performing anomaly detection, prediction, and\\nclassification on streaming data.

HTM is a biomimetic model based on the memory-prediction\\ntheory of brain function described by Jeff Hawkins in his book On Intelligence.\\nHTM is a method for discovering and inferring the high-level causes of observed\\ninput patterns and sequences, thus building an increasingly complex model of the\\nworld.</p>\\n<p>More information about HTMs: <a href=\\\"http://numenta.org/htm-white-paper.html\\\">http://numenta.org/htm-white-paper.html</a></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./events/2016/08/08/htm-bay-area-meetup.md\n ** module id = 1027\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Matthew Taylor\",\"brief\":null,\"date\":\"2016/09/25\",\"event\":{\"what\":\"Hierarchical Temporal Memory: Computing Like the Brain\",\"when\":{\"begin\":\"2016/09/25 12:40\",\"end\":\"2016/09/25 13:40\"},\"where\":{\"desc\":\"Online\",\"city\":null,\"state\":null,\"country\":null,\"web\":\"http://ai.withthebest.com/#Agenda\"},\"who\":\"Matthew Taylor\",\"why\":\"Speaking\"},\"featured\":false,\"image\":\"../images/image.png\",\"org\":\"HTM Community Leader\",\"tags\":\"ai with the best artificial intelligence htm hierarchical temporal memory computing like the brain\",\"title\":\"AI with the Best\",\"type\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<h3>Talk Abstract</h3>\\n<p><strong>Hierarchical Temporal Memory: Computing Like the Brain</strong></p>\\n<p>Most of today’s AI technologies are extensions of ANN models that were\\nenvisioned twenty years ago.

Here’s what some of our first customers have to say:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Having Grok monitor AWS CloudWatch to highlight unusual patterns is\\nextremely useful. It highlighted leading indicators of problems in my AWS\\nenvironment, which helped me prevent downtime.” – Greg Krill, Data Center\\nArchitect, Founder and Director, EdgeSense</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Grok is unique in that it delivers at-a-glance insight on top of our\\nexisting metrics. As it learns automatically, we spend less time maintaining\\nit and more time working on our technology,” – Chris Alexander, SysAdmin and\\nEngineer, Import IO</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>If you’d like to see Grok, we will be exhibiting at the AWS Summit in NYC on\\nJuly 10th.  Grok is also available on the AWS Marketplace with no license fee.</p>\\n<p>We are recruiting for two positions in our marketing department, one for a\\nproduct manager and one for a marketing manager [URL].

In addition,\\nwe decided to eliminate the paid version of Grok in order to make it super easy\\nfor customers to try and to deploy Grok.  If you are running an AWS installation\\nbut haven’t tried out Grok, you can do so\\n<a href=\\\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00I18SNQ6/ref=srh_res_product_title?ie=UTF8&amp;sr=0-2&amp;qid=1406131482540\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Then, in addition to Grok, we’ve created a group of demonstration applications\\nto show the potential use of our core technology in a variety of areas. We’ve\\npublished white papers on two of the demonstrations:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"/assets/pdf/whitepapers/Geospatial%20Tracking%20White%20Paper.pdf\\\">Geospatial Tracking</a>:\\nusing 2D or 3D speed and location data, learn travel patterns and detect\\nanomalies in objects or people moving through the world</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"/assets/pdf/whitepapers/Rogue%20Behavior%20Detection%20White%20Paper.pdf\\\">Rogue Behavior Detection</a>:\\nModel human behavioral patterns to highlight anomalies in employee actions\\nsuch as financial trading patterns, computer and device usage, and internal\\nsystem access.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>An additional demonstration application looks at anomalies in stock volume\\ntracking.

The application automatically models three\\ndata streams for each stock:  stock volume, stock price, and Twitter volume.  It\\nfigures out “normal” for each of these data streams for each company, and then\\nlets you know if something abnormal has occurred.</p>\\n<p>Here is what we hope you will notice when using HTM for Stocks:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>HTM enables automatic modeling of many models here, we are creating 600\\nseparate models (3 for each of 200 companies).  No human intervention is\\nrequired to adjust parameters or tune models.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>HTM models learn continuously, with each new data point.  If a company changes\\nits fundamentals, taking its stock volume to a new level, at first it will\\nshow an anomaly, but after a short period, it will learn the “new normal”.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The models are ranked by the most anomalous to the least anomalous.  If you\\nscroll down, you will note that many of the stocks show no anomalies.  This\\nranking of anomalies allows you to focus on the companies that are the most\\ndifferent from the norm.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/assets/img/pages/newsletters/2015-07-02/homescreen.png\\\" alt=\\\"HTM for Stocks Home Screen\\\"></p>\\n<p>Some of the anomalies detected by HTM for Stocks may appear obvious but others\\nare subtle and not easily detected by a human.  For example, if you watch stock\\nvolumes, you will see that there often is a spike in the beginning and at the\\nend of the trading day.  It will notice if those spikes continue longer than\\nnormal for that particular stock.  Such examples demonstrate the power of\\nfinding temporal patterns</p>\\n<p>When you see an anomaly, it’s very informative to look at the Twitter stream for\\nthe corresponding time frame.  There, you often will be able to quickly\\ndetermine the reason for the anomaly, such as an earnings announcement, a\\ntakeover bid, a lawsuit, or a rapidly growing interest in something the company\\ndid.</p>\\n<p>In keeping with our focus as a technology provider, we do not intend to build\\nHTM for Stocks into a full commercial application, and so we have provided the\\nsource code for HTM for Stocks alongside our NuPIC open source project at\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/numenta/numenta-apps\\\">https://github.com/numenta/numenta-apps</a>, available under a AGPL v3 license<sup><a href=\\\"#agpl\\\">*</a></sup>.\\nDevelopers may find that HTM for Stocks code can be used to create derivative\\nproducts that track other data streams.

Over the past few years we have made excellent\\nprogress in turning HTM cortical theory into a valuable technology, first for\\nstreaming analytics, but ultimately as a core component of machine intelligence.\\nIn order to demonstrate how HTM technology can be used, we created several\\nexample applications.  Our plan is to partner with applications developers to\\nbring commercial solutions to the market while we focus on developing the\\nscience and technology.  Earlier this year we announced our first such\\nrelationship with <a href=\\\"http://Cortical.io\\\">Cortical.io</a>, a company using HTM technology for natural\\nlanguage applications.</p>\\n<p>Avik Partners is our second commercial partnership.  Casey Kindiger, CEO of\\nAvik, is a proven entrepreneur with deep experience in IT and developer\\noperations.  Casey became intrigued with our Grok for IT Analytics example\\napplication, recognizing the substantial commercial potential for our advanced\\nanomaly detection capability in the IT environment, and approached us about a\\nlicense.</p>\\n<p>Our relationship with Avik is structured as a strategic partnership.  Avik will\\nassume our Grok for IT product (including the name Grok), enhance the\\napplication with the many features that have been requested, and market it to\\nenterprise IT organizations.  Avik will be doing business on the\\n<a href=\\\"http://grokstream.com\\\">http://grokstream.com</a> website, where you can sign up to receive information\\nwhen the product is available.  We expect to complete the transition of the Grok\\nfor IT Analytics product to Avik within 30 days.  As part of the license,\\nNumenta has taken a minority ownership position in Avik.</p>\\n<p>We believe that Avik is an ideal partner to apply HTM technology to solve major\\nproblems in complex IT organizations.  Given the breadth of potential HTM\\napplications, we are excited about our discussions with several other potential\\nlicensees who want to apply HTM technology to a wide variety of application\\ndomains.  Over time, we hope to establish a constellation of partners building\\nintelligent applications using HTM technology.</p>\\n<p>In order to facilitate consideration of a license, we have created several\\nstandard license options.  We realize that these standard licenses won’t fit\\nevery situation, so we also offer custom licenses.  We have just published a new\\n<a href=\\\"/assets/pdf/apps/licensing-guide.pdf\\\">license guide</a> with details.  If you are\\ninterested in becoming a licensee, please review this document, and feel free to\\nwrite to us at <a href=\\\"mailto:sales@numenta.com\\\">sales@numenta.com</a>.</p>\\n<p>Please join me in congratulating Casey and Avik Partners.  We look forward to\\nworking together to bring machine intelligence to improve management of IT\\ninfrastructure.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./newsletter/2015/09/01/partnership-between-numenta-and-avik-partners-on-grok-for-it-analytics.md\n ** module id = 1118\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"74267284c3a0a1764fde6bcfd45a62cd.png\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./newsletter/2015/10/01/images/image@2x.png\n ** module id = 1120\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"author\":\"Donna Dubinsky\",\"brief\":\"To start with, I’m pleased to announce that we have a paper accepted on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB).

I’ve written to you about the development of\\nNAB in the past.  NAB is essentially two things.  First, it consists of over 50\\nstreaming data files with anomalies that are marked for ground truth.  These\\nfiles are a combination of real-world data sets along with some simulated data\\nsets.  Second, there is a scoring mechanism that is designed for streaming data.\\nNumenta’s HTM algorithms do a great job at finding temporal structure, learning\\ncontinuously, and detecting anomalies early.  These are valuable properties for\\nreal-time streaming applications but benchmarks designed for batch data don’t\\nincorporate them. For example, traditional benchmarks do not give “credit” for\\nfinding an anomaly sooner rather than later.  Our development of NAB is an\\neffort to create such a benchmark.</p>\\n<p>We will be releasing NAB into open source such that the community can add new\\ndata sets, propose different scoring mechanisms, and test/compare other\\nalgorithms with HTM.  We hope that the developers in the community will get\\nbehind NAB and enable a robust comparison of our anomaly detection with other\\ntechniques.</p>\\n<p>For more information on NAB, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB\\\">go here</a>. We will\\nbe presenting NAB at two conferences\\n(<a href=\\\"http://mlconf.com/events/san-francisco-ca/\\\">MLconf SF</a> on November 13 in\\nSan Francisco, and the\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.icmla-conference.org/icmla15/\\\">IEEE Conference on Machine Learning and Applications</a>\\non December 9-11 in Miami), so if you are in the vicinity, we hope you will be\\nable to attend. Of course, once the paper is published, we will send you\\nthe link.</p>\\n<p>My second topic is an update from the NuPIC community.  We recently announced\\nthe HTM Challenge.  The idea of the HTM Challenge is to provide a structure to\\nencourage members of our open source community to create HTM sample\\napplications. And, to add an extra incentive, we’re offering cash prizes of\\n$3000 for first place, $2000 for second place and $1000 for third place, along\\nwith some fun door prizes.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/\\\">Numenta HTM Challenge</a> is an online\\ncontest open for submissions now and running until November 14th. Participants\\npropose ideas for real-world applications of HTM technology and submit them for\\napproval before starting work. We will check that the problem being solved is\\napplicable to HTM, and that the data being analyzed is a good fit for HTM.\\nOnce a project has been approved, hackers have until November 6th to work on it\\nand submit a demo video for judging.</p>\\n<p>This Challenge can be completed entirely online, but we encourage you to try to\\nattend the <a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711586/\\\">onsite event</a> that\\nculminates the Challenge on Saturday, November 14 in Redwood City, California.\\nAt this event, all demonstration videos will be viewed by a judging panel and a\\nlive audience. Judges will get a chance to comment and ask questions to\\nsubmission authors (either live or over the phone). At the end of the event,\\nwe’ll announce the winners and cash prizes will be awarded.</p>\\n<p>In addition to judging, there will also be at least two educational sessions by\\nNumenta team members Subutai Ahmad and Jeff Hawkins. They will be talking about\\nthe history and evolution of HTM algorithms, the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark, and\\nsome details about new algorithm development.</p>\\n<p>You don’t have to participate in the Challenge to attend the onsite event.\\nMaybe you just want to come see the latest presentations from Numenta or watch\\nthe Challenge demonstration judging. That’s great! We welcome you to mingle with\\nus HTM enthusiasts.\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711586/\\\">Register here</a>.</p>\\n<p>And as long as you’ll be in the area, there is a community event being planned\\non Friday, November 13, the day before the onsite event. I hope you’ll come meet\\nthe rest of the HTM community. This event is run by the NuPIC community, for the\\nNuPIC community. A schedule is in the works.\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711563/\\\">RSVP here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Stay tuned for more information on NAB and on the HTM Challenge.  I’ll update\\nyou as both projects develop.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, let me remind you that Avik Partners has now taken over the Grok for IT\\nproduct.

For example, you don’t have to know what you’re\\nlooking for to find these real-time anomalies. HTM starts learning hundreds of\\nmodels immediately.  In this case, it creates a model for three data streams per\\nstock: stock price, stock volume and Twitter volume.

No\\nhuman intervention is required. You don’t have to tune it or define parameters.\\nYou don’t need to know anything about the stocks.

Because neuroscience is the foundation of everything we do, it’s\\nimportant to have our work published and critiqued in peer-reviewed neuroscience\\njournals.  I’m excited to announce that Jeff Hawkins and Subutai Ahmad’s recent\\nmanuscript, “<a href=\\\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncir.2016.00023/abstract\\\">Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence\\nMemory in Neocortex</a>,”\\nhas been accepted to Frontiers in Neural Circuits Journal, a publication devoted\\nto research in neural circuits, serving the worldwide neuroscience community.</p>\\n<p>We believe this paper will prove to be a significant contribution to brain\\ntheory as well as introduce algorithms that will be important for machine\\nintelligence.  The paper proposes a model of cortical neurons that explains why\\nthey have thousands of synapses, why the synapses are segregated onto different\\nparts of the dendrites, and how neurons integrate this input in a functionally\\nmeaningful way.  There are many aspects of this neuron model that are novel.\\nThe paper also provides a new and detailed theory of how networks of neurons\\nthroughout the neocortex learn sequences and make predictions.</p>\\n<p>This theory is radically different than the models used in most artificial\\nneural networks such as deep learning and LSTM sequence memory. Deep learning\\nand LSTM use artificial neurons that are simplistic and not biologically\\naccurate.  Many deep learning models do not incorporate sequence memory at all.\\nYet sequence memory is a critical component of the brain.  In fact, we believe\\nthat learning and recalling sequences of patterns is the basic operation common\\nto all brain function.</p>\\n<p>Why is sequence memory so important? Because everything we as humans do is\\nsequence based. When we hear someone talk, we take in a sequence of words; when\\nwe look at something, our eyes saccade, moving quickly over the image, leading\\nto a sequence of inputs from the retina; when we move our bodies, we’re\\noutputting a sequence of motor commands, which causes changes in our inputs. It\\nis this understanding of how sequence memory works in the brain that allows our\\nsoftware to perform continuous, unsupervised learning without any training data.</p>\\n<p>In case you are not familiar with academic publishing, being published in a\\njournal like Frontiers is not as simple as writing and submitting your paper.\\nIt involves a meticulous, multi-step review process where independent reviewers\\nprovide feedback and request changes before accepting or denying the paper.\\nThis paper is ambitious in how many new ideas it introduces, and took over a\\nyear from when we first decided to write it to now, when it has been accepted.</p>\\n<p>I invite you to read <a href=\\\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncir.2016.00023/abstract\\\">the paper</a>,\\nand for those that want a less technical overview, I encourage you to read\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/543486/single-artificial-neuron-taught-to-recognize-hundreds-of-patterns/\\\">this article by MIT Tech Review</a>,\\nwhich summarizes the findings of our pre-published version.</p>\\n<p>Speaking of papers, we also recently completed a new white paper that addresses\\none of the most popular topics that we’re asked when people are learning about\\nNumenta’s HTM theory: encoders.  The paper, <a href=\\\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05925\\\">Encoding Data for HTM Systems</a>,\\nwritten by Scott Purdy, our Director of Engineering, describes how to encode\\ndata into Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) so that the data can be used\\nin HTM systems.

Yet early detection is easier said\\nthan done, and traditional methods like thresholds often miss the subtle\\nanomalies common within streaming data. Because HTM learns continuously and\\nwithout supervision, it finds these types of anomalies very well.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://numenta.com/htm-studio/\\\">HTM Studio</a> provides a way for anyone, even non-technical people, to\\nexperiment with HTM for anomaly detection on their own data, without having to\\nupload anything to the cloud. After downloading HTM Studio, you can import a\\nlocal csv file, and with a few clicks, HTM analyzes your data and displays any\\nanomalies it finds.  For those who don’t have streaming data sets, HTM Studio\\ncomes with pre-loaded sample data.</p>\\n<p>We hope that this release encourages broad experimentation with our technology.\\nTry it on your home automation data to uncover anomalies in your usage patterns,\\nor your sleep data to find abnormalities in your sleep-wake cycles, or your\\ncompany’s sensors to see where unusual activity is occurring in the office. All\\nyou need is a csv file with one Date/Time column, one header row and at least\\n400 rows of numeric data listed in chronological order.  For more on how to\\nensure your data is in the right format for HTM Studio, watch this\\n<a href=\\\"http://youtu.be/f80ewxLvgks\\\">short tutorial video</a>.  HTM Studio provides an easy way to do a proof of\\nconcept before fully implementing or deploying HTM. It also removes the\\ntechnical hurdle and steep learning curve that typically accompanies HTM\\nexperimentation.</p>\\n<p>As a company with a scientific mission to understand how the brain learns, it’s\\nbeen hard for us to make this technology accessible, which is why we are so\\nproud of this release.

The technology can be applied to anomaly\\ndetection in servers and applications, human behavior, and geo-spatial tracking\\ndata, and to the predication and classification of natural language. In\\naddition, Numenta has created NuPIC (Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing)\\nas an open source project. Based in Redwood City, CA, the company is privately\\nfunded.

Voluminous amounts of this data are being stored for later analysis,\\nthough it often isn’t necessary or practical to capture and store all the\\ninformation. Instead, data analysts need a way to analyze time-series data in\\nreal time, identify when something is different and act upon that insight.</p>\\n<p>Different approaches are being pursued to solve this problem, in the form of\\nanomaly detection algorithms. But until now, a measurement to gauge the\\neffectiveness of real-time anomaly detection algorithms has been lacking. With\\nthis goal in mind, Numenta created NAB.</p>\\n<p>“There is an explosion in real-time streaming data sources.  Data owners want to\\nbe able to model this data and figure out if anything has changed,” commented\\nNumenta CEO Donna Dubinsky.  “We created this open benchmark as a tool to help\\ndata scientists evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms in finding\\nanomalous behavior in these data streams.”</p>\\n<p>Early anomaly detection in streaming data has practical and significant\\napplications across many industries – from monitoring critical IT infrastructure\\nto detecting potential fraudulent financial transactions, from understanding\\nenergy consumption to geo-tracking of vehicles in logistics networks.</p>\\n<h4>The Numenta Anomaly Benchmark</h4>\\n<p>NAB is an open source framework that was created to help data professionals\\ntest, score and evaluate anomaly detection algorithms on time-series data and to\\ncompare their internal anomaly detection techniques to published algorithms.</p>\\n<p>NAB also allows people to test their algorithms against Numenta’s HTM detector,\\nwhich is based on Numenta’s Hierarchical Temporal Memory technology. It uses a\\nbiologically inspired memory prediction algorithm to model real-time data\\nstreams and continuously learns.</p>\\n<p>The major components to the NAB framework include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Real-world data. Includes 58 labeled streaming data files that are a\\ncombination of real-world data sets along with some simulated datasets. All\\nanomalies are marked.</li>\\n<li>Anomaly windows. These are defined ranges of data points that surround a known\\nanomaly label. NAB uses these windows to decide whether, and how early, an\\nalgorithm detected each anomaly.</li>\\n<li>A scoring mechanism. Scoring is specifically designed for streaming data and\\nrewards early detection.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>“NAB’s emphasis on anomaly windows and early detection is pioneering. In\\naddition the research community stands to benefit greatly from an open dataset\\ncontaining real world data, and an open source tool for measuring the\\neffectiveness of real-time anomaly detection algorithms,” said Varun Chandola,\\nAssistant Professor in Computer Science and Engineering, SUNY Buffalo.</p>\\n<p>“Having a standard benchmark could spur innovation in real-time anomaly\\ndetection algorithms. Our hope is the open source community will add new data\\nsets, propose different scoring mechanisms, and test and compare other\\nalgorithms with our HTM algorithms,” said Dubinsky.</p>\\n<p>For more detailed information on NAB, go to:</p>\\n<p><strong>NAB Peer-Reviewed Research Paper</strong> <br/> <t render=\\\"hbs\\\">\\n{{site.paths.ext.paper.nab}}\\n</t></p>\\n<p><strong>NAB Business White Paper</strong> <br/>\\n<a href=\\\"http://numenta.com/assets/pdf/numenta-anomaly-benchmark/NAB-Business-Paper.pdf\\\">http://numenta.com/assets/pdf/numenta-anomaly-benchmark/NAB-Business-Paper.pdf</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Numenta Anomaly Benchmark Repository</strong> <br/>\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/numenta/NAB\\\">https://github.com/numenta/NAB</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Algorithm &amp; product code</strong> <br/>\\n<a href=\\\"http://numenta.org\\\">http://numenta.org</a></p>\\n<h4>About Numenta</h4>\\n<p>Founded in 2005, Numenta has developed a cohesive theory, core software\\ntechnology, and numerous applications all based on principles of the neocortex.\\nLaying the groundwork for the new era of machine intelligence, this technology\\nis ideal for large-scale analysis of continuously streaming data sets and excels\\nat modeling and predicting patterns in data.

That question is of paramount importance to both neuroscientists and\\ntechnologists who want to build intelligent machines.</p>\\n<p>It has been understood for over a hundred years that the inputs and outputs of\\nthe brain are constantly changing sequences of patterns and therefore learning\\nand recalling sequences must be a fundamental operation of neurons.

A paper, authored by Numenta co-founder Jeff Hawkins\\nand VP of Research Subutai Ahmad, <a href=\\\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncir.2016.00023/full\\\">“Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A\\nTheory of Sequence Memory in Neocortex,”</a>*\\nhas been published in the Frontiers in Neural Circuits Journal, a publication\\ndevoted to research in neural circuits, serving the worldwide neuroscience\\ncommunity.</p>\\n<p>“This study is a key milestone on the path to achieving that long-sought goal of\\ncreating truly intelligent machines that simulate human cerebral cortex and\\nforebrain system operations,” commented Michael Merzenich, PhD, Professor\\nEmeritus UCSF, Chief Scientific Officer for Posit Science.</p>\\n<p>The Numenta paper introduces two advances. First, it provides an explanation of\\nwhy neurons in the neocortex have thousands of synapses, and why the synapses\\nare segregated onto different parts of the cell, called dendrites. The authors\\npropose that the majority of these synapses are used to learn transitions of\\npatterns, a feature missing from most artificial neural networks. Second, the\\nauthors show that neurons with these properties, arranged in layers and\\ncolumns - a structure observed throughout the neocortex - form a powerful\\nsequence memory. This suggests the new sequence memory algorithm could be a\\nunifying principle for understanding how the neocortex works. Through\\nsimulations, the authors show the new sequence memory exhibits a number of\\nimportant properties such as the ability to learn complex sequences, continuous\\nunsupervised learning, and extremely high fault tolerance.</p>\\n<img src=\\\"../images/image.jpg\\\" class=\\\"center-block img-responsive media-border\\\" alt=\\\"Neuron image\\\" />\\n<div class=\\\"caption\\\">\\n  **Comparison of Biological and Artificial Neuron Models:**\\n  The Hawkins-Ahmad paper on the theory of sequence memory in the neocortex\\n  proposes a model of cortical neurons that explains why they have thousands of\\n  synapses, why the synapses are segregated onto different parts of the\\n  dendrites, and how neurons integrate this input in a functionally meaningful\\n  way. This diagram draws a comparison between the human neocortical pyramidal\\n  neuron, the HTM biologically-inspired neuron model, and the model used in most\\n  mathematically-inspired artificial neural networks and Deep Learning models\\n  today.\\n</div>\\n<p>“Our paper makes contributions in both neuroscience and machine learning,”\\nHawkins noted. “From a neuroscience perspective, it offers a computational model\\nof pyramidal neurons, explaining how a neuron can effectively use thousands of\\nsynapses and computationally active dendrites to learn sequences. From a machine\\nlearning and computer science perspective, it introduces a new sequence memory\\nalgorithm that we believe will be important in building intelligent machines.”</p>\\n<p>“This research extends the work Jeff first outlined in his 2004 book On\\nIntelligence and encompasses many years of research we have undertaken here at\\nNumenta,” said Ahmad, “It explains the neuroscience behind our HTM (Hierarchical\\nTemporal Memory) technology and makes several detailed predictions that can be\\nexperimentally verified. The software we have created proves that the theory\\nactually works in real world applications.”</p>\\n<p>Numenta’s primary goal is to reverse engineer the neocortex, to understand the\\ndetailed biology underlying intelligence. The Numenta team also believes this is\\nthe quickest route to creating machine intelligence. As a result of this\\napproach, the neuron and network models described in the new paper are\\nstrikingly different than the neuron and network models being used in today’s\\ndeep learning and other artificial neural networks.

If HTM Studio finds interesting anomalies, then a user can do a\\nfull implementation or deployment of HTM.</p>\\n<p>“Detecting anomalies early in streaming data can have significant value, but\\nit’s difficult to do. We wanted to make it easy to try HTM on your own streaming\\ndata,” said Donna Dubinsky, CEO of Numenta. “With HTM Studio, no coding skills\\nare required. Parameters are automatically set. In a matter of minutes, you can\\nvisualize anomalies in your datasets.”</p>\\n<p>For those who don’t have streaming data readily available, HTM Studio includes\\npre-loaded datasets for experimentation. Sample datasets include a variety of\\nuse cases: IoT sensors, preventative maintenance, tracking vehicles and network\\nservers.</p>\\n<p>The tool is available at no charge for Mac and Windows desktop systems.
