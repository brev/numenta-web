Why wouldn’t I use the free AGPL version\n                for my product?\n              </DefineTitle>\n              <DefineItem>\n                You are welcome to do so under the terms of that license. AGPL\n                is a “copyleft” license. It requires that if you distribute or\n                make available your software (either directly or through a\n                SaaS model), you must also distribute the source code under\n                the AGPL license. For some companies and some situations, that\n                is an acceptable requirement. However, companies who want to\n                keep the resulting code proprietary will prefer a commercial\n                license.\n              </DefineItem>\n              <DefineTitle>\n                If I do not intend to distribute or make available as a SaaS\n                implementation any derivative software, then it seems to me\n                that I can use the AGPL version internally without any\n                additional license, even if it is for a commercial purpose.\n                For example, I run a hedge fund and I figured out how to use\n                NuPIC to advantage, but I don’t distribute the software or\n                results, nor do I make it available to others. Is this\n                correct?\n              </DefineTitle>\n              <DefineItem>\n                Generally you may use the software and patents for internal\n                use under the AGPL. Note, however, if you do not use our\n                open-source software (and thus do not fall under the AGPL),\n                you WOULD need a license for our IP. For example, say you do\n                your own, very specific version of HTM for your hedge fund.\n                Once you deploy that within your company for any productive\n                purpose (as opposed to research), you would need an IP license\n                from us because you are not under the AGPL.\n              </DefineItem>\n              <DefineTitle>\n                I’m a researcher who uses different machine learning\n                techniques.
