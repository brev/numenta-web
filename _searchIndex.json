This is a good place to be if you are interested in machine intelligence and brain modeling. I started studying brain theory over thirty years ago. At that time most computer scientists didn t think the brain was relevant to AI and most biologists thought the brain was so complicated that it would take hundreds of years to decipher how it works. Today both these viewpoints have changed. We are making good progress in understanding how the brain works and many people believe that emulating the brain is the best path to machine intelligence. In 2005 I wrote a book (along with Sandra Blakeslee) that described the neocortex as a hierarchy of nearly identical memory regions where each region learns and recalls sequences. Sequence memory is a huge part of how we understand the world. We need sequence memory to understand speech, touch, and vision. We also use it to generate behavior. But learning sequences from millions of noisy sensory bits is tricky. In 2009, after several years of studying this problem, we think we figured it out. We now understand how hundreds of thousands of neurons (arranged in layers as observed in the neocortex) learn the spatial and temporal patterns in sensory data. Since the fall of 2009 we tested this theory extensively and embedded the algorithms in a product called Grok. We call the theory the Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA) and the code we wrote to implement the CLA is the heart of NuPIC. As of today you can access this code and experiment with and modify the CLA yourself. In this blog entry I want to articulate my hopes and fears for NuPIC. Let s start with what I hope we will accomplish. I hope NuPIC will accelerate the creation of machine intelligence. The CLA is a unique theory of how large ensembles of real neurons work together in the neocortex. If we are right about this, then the CLA is a major building block of biological intelligence and it will also be a major building block of machine intelligence. Here s a rough analogy going from understanding a single neuron to a layer of neurons is like going from an isolated transistor to an integrated circuit. And just like a single integrated circuit is not a computer, the CLA is not an intelligent machine; it is just an important component. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done. We need to better characterize the CLA on how it works with different types of data. We need to make the CLA faster in both HW and SW. We need mathematical analysis of the CLA to know its theoretical limits. We need to figure out how to use the CLA to generate motor behavior, something that is done in every region of the neocortex. And we need to combine CLAs in hierarchies. I hope NuPIC contributors will work on all these problems. I hope some contributors will accelerate our progress by creating better documentation, better code examples, and better educational materials. We need to create a reading list and references to relevant science papers. And finally I hope that some people will embed NuPIC in clever new products. Now my fears. I fear that expectations will get ahead of reality. Two years after my book was published I ran into someone at a conference. He said he loved On Intelligence but was now disappointed. He wanted to know why I had not made much progress since the book came out. Let me be frank. The CLA is based on novel concepts that present a steep learning curve. This stuff is not easy. I can assure you that once you understand it, you will see a beauty in it. But most people take months to deeply understand the CLA. The tasks of creating hierarchies of CLAs and adding in motor capabilities are very difficult. Even just using the CLA in its current form is not trivial due to the learning required. Understanding the brain and building fantastically intelligent machines is a grand quest for humanity. It is worth struggling, overcoming obstacles, and working hard to achieve this quest. If you want something quick and easy to work on, this isn t it. NuPIC is for those who are crazy enough to pursue grand dreams but who are grounded enough to make practical progress today.

It s been exciting to see the early positive reaction to our NuPIC open source project (Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing). As part of the team that helped start this project, I m optimistic that great work will come out of it over time. Several people have asked what we intend to do regarding patents related to open source code in NuPIC. I am posting this blog entry to let you know our intentions. Grok (previously called Numenta) has done significant work in machine learning and cortical modeling. Consequently, we have filed and received numerous patents on our work. To date, we have 25 issued and allowed patents, and have more under review. These patents cover a wide range of intellectual property, from claims that read on the core algorithms, to claims that pertain to specific attributes of our product, Grok. When we decided to open source NuPIC, we did extensive investigation into the range of open source licenses available. We settled on GPLv3. Under GPLv3, all contributors to a project must grant to all other contributors an explicit license to any patents expressed in their contribution. We believe that to enable free use of our software (as in the software freedom sense), we must include a license to those patents that pertain to the work included, which is partly why we selected v3 of the GPL rather than earlier versions. Therefore if you have downloaded our software and accepted the GPLv3 license, we will not assert patents on this material against you. It should be noted that Numenta/Grok holds patents that do not pertain to the algorithms released in NuPIC. We do not view these patents as covered under the GPL, and we reserve the right to use these patents in the normal course of our business. We ve asked ourselves whether we should continue to seek patent protection on the work that is in the open source project. After all, it costs money and it takes time that could be used for other priorities. Thinking through it, we have decided to continue to file for patents in the future, although probably at a reduced rate. Why would we continue to file patents on work that is going to be open source? The principle reason is to protect the NuPIC community. For example, outside developers could work on similar concepts without becoming part of the open source community. They could seek patents on their own work, making it proprietary and blocking progress of open source NuPIC developers. By keeping our patent portfolio current, we retain the ability to protect the NuPIC community from these threats. In other words, by holding patents on the work, we are able to protect the whole community from others who might seek to wall off their work through patents. In addition to filing select patents going forward, we also will evaluate other measures that would enhance patent protection for the NuPIC community. I welcome your feedback on our patent position. Please send comments to <help@numenta.org>. And I welcome you to NuPIC, our new, open source community. I know that this is the beginning of a long road, but I also know that it s a road with great promise to change the future.

My Experience at the First NuPIC Hackathon A guest blog post by Erik Blas. You can find the project on Github, and more information on the the main page of this site. One could not begin to describe my initial excitement at receiving an invitation to attend. I ve been inspired by Jeff Hawkin s work since I stumbled across his 2007 TED talk, and later reading his book On Intelligence. This being my first hackathon, I decided to just assume it was going to be like a typical crunch time day. Introduction pow wow and problem scoping, each person swarms or picks up their piece of the puzzle, and we go about the process of turning b1p2 (1 beer to 2 pizza slices) into code. This pretty much took place in fits and starts, as this is the initial offering of NuPIC we were working with. Documentation was (still is) sparse, and there were no community established workflows for getting new OPF clients off the ground. Up until just a few weeks prior, all the code we were working with was in use only for Grok Solutions clients. Strangers in a strange land, we were. There was a lot of confusion on just how to use the software. Numenta provided a VM with pre-baked environments using Vagrant and Virtual Box. A few successfully built the software on their own platform of choice. The static binding of certain libs and some of the build steps had a propensity to make porting difficult, as well as the reliance on Python 2.6. Once building was no longer an issue (in general), the next part was getting all of the tests and experiments running. Environment issues played the lead gremlin in this instance, but once the proper library paths were exported we were victorious! The OPF The Online Prediction Framework ties together all the disparate parts of the CLA functions and HTM regions. To break it down, you re working with a data stream and its subsequent encoding. A data stream can be (and often is for pre-training) a CSV file, live streaming data, a generator, etc. A client takes the data stream, and feeds it to an instance of a model, one record at a time, which then returns your prediction result for the next N steps (depending on your model configuration). This result and a bunch of meta is stored for you in a ModelResult object. Steps here mean the feeding of 1 record into a model and its return of the ModelResult object, not necessarily tied to clock time. Models can either be pre-trained and loaded from disk, or an instance of a new model. Data and Encoders A lot of us spent the majority of our time trying to figure out the best encoding schema for our data, once we managed to wrap our heads around the OPF. This has remained true for all of my current projects with the OPF, and I suspect will be the stickiest point for other novices. One has to be able to conceptualize your problem as a sequence, temporal or otherwise, and then piecemeal that sequence into individual parts, associative in some way to the inference you re looking for. For my demo, predepic, it turned out to be a simple classification problem: Which sensor shows the most activity, and thus indicates my position? Once you get past this point, it s a matter of running test sequences and tweaking your model parameters (I may write more on this in a subsequent post). Demos Watch the Footage No, seriously, they are cool and I cannot give them justice. Here s mine: Implications Gleaned from the Demos One key thing that jumped out at me, is the different types of data we were able to feed to NuPIC models, and achieve high value results. With the only real project-specific work being contained in model parameters! Everything from MIDI file data to record classification strings, and NuPIC munched on them all. All one needs is an encoder to handle the data types, and you can go far with the encoders provided by the OPF. Concluding Thoughts, and What I m Up To The immensely gracious hosting and helpfulness of the Numenta staff cannot be overstated! Beyond the gloriously delicious food, endless supply of beer and other essentials, and the ample and comfortable workspaces, the conversations over NuPIC and the work going forward blew me away the most. Special shout out to: - Ian, for lending me your parts and helping me refine my project! - Matt, your tireless work in the community is awesome man. Do you not sleep? - Jeff, your efforts continue to inspire! Thank you for opening this project to the community. - Subutai, for your conversations and explanations. - Scott, I m not sure many of our projects would have gotten off the ground without your help and quick production of simple examples. - Office Management Staff, for keeping us alive and making everyone feel at home! - Pete, for not laughing at my lame html and javascript skills while simultaneously making my web console not suck. - Winfried, for the fascinating discussions. I m nerding out on the implications of your work! Maybe it was the sleep deprivation (both leading up to and during the event), but I walked away with a whole new mindset. I ll never see anything the same way again. I look for the subtle sequencing behind it all, and wonder if I can encode it. Woah At this point, I plan to continue solving the build problem. Having NuPIC build easily across platforms is vital for widespread adoption. We need more minds on this project to extend and improve our understanding of this model of intelligence. I m also working on distributing model work load and selective evolution. I ll save the details for posts as I build and work on these, but the bit selective evolution bears some explanation. Selective evolution of models is the idea of running multiple model instances, with the same encoders tuned differently, being fed the same data. One chooses the model with the best predictive performance to continue forward. I d recommend anyone interested head into the #nupic channel on IRC and post to the mailing list. I can be found on IRC as @rava, and also on the mailing list. Also, here is my personal fork of NuPIC (it s a mess in there).

Although this RFI is only a few weeks old, I feel like I have been waiting for it for thirty years. Here are a few quotes from the RFI. IARPA is interested in understanding the neural algorithms that form the basis of inference and recognition in the brain. This RFI specifically addresses mathematical, computational, or otherwise executable models of cortical computing primitives that are supported by known neuroanatomy. Information regarding models that are purely conceptual, schematic, or descriptive in nature (i.e. models that cannot be instantiated), or regarding models that are not grounded in neuroscience, is not sought at this time. I couldn t have been happier than when I read these words. For thirty years I have been promoting the idea that the path to machine intelligence must start with a detailed understanding of how the brain works. Until recently this idea had few adherents. I vividly recall being told by faculty at the MIT AI Lab that studying brains was a waste of time! Prominent neuroscientists told me it will take hundreds of years to understand the neocortex. And many machine learning experts have told me that brains are, at best, good for inspiration but the details are not important. Of course not everyone felt this way, but for many years I could count on one hand the people I knew who studied the neocortex in order to build intelligent machines. But times are changing. In the past year there has been a resurgence of interest in hierarchical memory models (newly renamed deep learning ) which are loosely based on cortical principles. DARPA (another U.S. agency) is working on creating hardware that closely mimics cortical architecture. There is the European Human Brain Project and the recently announced U.S. BRAIN Initiative , both striving to understand how the neocortex works. And now there is the IARPA RFI, which is remarkable in that it explicitly says they are only interested in learning algorithms that are based on the detailed anatomy of the neocortex. Of course the Cortical Learning Algorithm developed here at Numenta and now part of the NuPIC open source project is a prime example of the cortical computing principle being sought by IARPA. We will probably respond to the RFI. It is too early to claim this new interest in cortical computing is here to stay and whether it will continue to adhere to neuroanatomy. But it feels that the momentum of the machine intelligence world is shifting slowly towards making biology an equal partner and this is a good thing. Here is a link to the IARPA RFI. Thanks to Kevin Archie who sent it to the NuPIC email group.

Jeff Fohl There was fantastic energy in the room, something that only reinforced my sense that Numenta is on to something really big. Johann Schleier-Smith Very informative and spiked my interest in machine learning and NuPIC. Venkat Venkataraju Great event, convinced to jump in and start experimenting. Numenta seems to be going in the right direction. Brian Eppert Great experience. Intelligent people, insightful talks. I was totally new to NuPIC and although I didn t complete a project, I feel like I ve learned a lot about the technology and the whole approach. Nikolay Samusik I think we had a nice mix of people at the event, e.g. from those focused on neuroscience biological aspects, to those just getting their feet wet, a few hackers applying NuPIC to some applications, and the great staff. Great new introductions, good conversations and informational sessions. Definitely an event worth attending! Ari Kamlani Hacking in progress! Videos We tried to record everything we could, which included all the sessions (minus one because of a technical glitch). My apologies for the poor audio and video in some of these. We had a wireless microphone failure because of unanticipated RF interference. We attempted to live-stream everything on YouTube via Google Hangout, which meant we sacrificed quality.

In this presentation, I present some of the initial progress I made. - Video - Slides Deep Dive Subutai Ahmad, Grok/Numenta VP of Engineering, detailed some aspects of the CLA. He discussed an interesting property of SDR s affecting temporal pooling and hierarchies. The interactive session included a lot of Q&A - Video - Slides Sensori-Motor Integration Most of the changes on our senses are due, wholly or in part, to our own actions. Therefore, the neocortex learns a sensory-motor model of the world. In this talk, Jeff discussed some of what we know about how the neocortex generates behavior and how we might construct a simple sensory-motor system based on the Cortical Learning Algorithm. It is a good starting point for anyone wanting to add motor output to the CLA. - Video - Slides Q&A This was an informal question and answer session between some hackathon attendees and Jeff and Subutai. - Video CEPT Word-SDRs Francisco Webber talked about his service that provides text comparison and association services, as well as SDRs for English words. He described in great detail how these SDRs are created, and talked about how they are being used by Phase 6 in their effort to apply this technology to better English education opportunities. - Video - Slides Demos Full Videos of all Hackathon Demonstrations. NTA CAR Matt compiled and ran NuPIC on a Raspberry Pi, and wired up some wheels, a controller, and light-sensitive sensors to help drive it.

You may have a set of possible inputs (as alternatives), and want to evaluate which would lead to the best (predicted) outcome. The demonstration will include mice, a maze, and some cheese. - Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XjYXFRIAQ&start=1970 - Code: https://github.com/EronWright/nupic-mouse - By: Eron Wright Visualizing Word-SDRs Continuing with the NLP project I introduced in the Kickoff presentation, I created bitmap images of the word SDRs predicted by the NuPIC temporal pooler and compared them to the words the CEPT API associated them with. - Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XjYXFRIAQ&start=3240 - Code: https://github.com/rhyolight/nupic_nlp - By: Matt Taylor Pilot This team taught the CLA to learn to control a quadcopter. Their objective was to pilot the quadcopter by controlling its vertical speed to fly to a desired altitude and hover there. The supervised learning approach involved having the CLA watch an expert flyer and learn those sequences, and use its prediction of those sequences to directly control the copter in the face of noise. - Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XjYXFRIAQ&start=4080 - Code: https://github.com/chetan51/pilot - By: Chetan Surpur, Jay Gokhale, Josh Rose, Xuyen On, Eron Wright Spatial Pooler Visualization Ian showed a very enlightening visualization of a live spatial pooler being fed parts of an image, one piece at a time.

Jeff Hawkins and Numenta VP of Engineering Subutai Ahmad will be at this event to go through the CLA Quiz, a serious of challenging questions about how NuPIC algorithms work. These questions were originally created for new employees and interns to research in order to better understand the CLA. Tomorrow, we re going to be asking you! If you re interested in taking part, or just joining in to listen, please use your Google account and request an RSVP to our Office Hour. We ll be happy to invite you. If you can t make it, the video will be posted on YouTube. The CLA Quiz 1. Is an untrained CLA spatial pooler just a random hash (random mapping from input to output vector)? Why or why not? What happens to the output of the spatial pooler if you randomly change one bit in the input. 2. Can you do spatial pooling with small numbers? For example, is it reasonable to have an SP with 20 columns? If not, why are large numbers important in SDR s? What s the difference between picking 5 columns out of 50 vs \"50 out of 500\"? Both have 10% sparsity. What s the difference between picking 50 out of 100 vs \"50 out of 1000\"? Both will output 50 1 s. 3. What s the difference between picking 5 columns out of 50 vs \"50 out of 500\"? Both have 10% sparsity. 4. What s the difference between picking 50 out of 100 vs \"50 out of 1000\"? Both will output 50 1 s. 5. Suppose the input vector (input to the SP) is 10,000 bits long, with 5% sparsity. What is the right value of coincInputPoolPct? How do you figure this out? 6. How does the SDR representation of input A in isolation, and input B in isolation, compare with the SDR representation of input A overlapped with B? Alternatively, how does the representation of a horizontal line and the representation of a vertical line compare with the representation of a cross? 7. Suppose we have an input vector that is 10,000 bits long. Suppose the spatial pooler has 500 columns, of which 50 are active at any time. Can we distinguish many patterns, or a small number? Which patterns are likely to be confused? What happens to the SDR representation if we add noise to the patterns? What happens if we add occlusions? 8. Can we distinguish many patterns, or a small number? Which patterns are likely to be confused? 9. What happens to the SDR representation if we add noise to the patterns? 10. What happens if we add occlusions? 11. What are disadvantages of SDR s? 12. How does online learning happen in the SP? Whoa! That s Deep These questions a bit over your head?

We created the NuPIC open source environment with the desire to build a broad community to work on these algorithms, to advance the science, and to build applications that can integrate the technology into people s lives. We imagined academic work as well as commercial work, both open source and proprietary. We chose the GPLv3 license as a way to achieve these goals. In our GPLv3 license, you do not have to pay any license fee to get started. If you create something that you d like to distribute, then you are required to make this source code available. This is a great option for academics and members of the open source community, but in some cases will not be appropriate for a commercial application. In the cases where a developer has created something that they would like to keep proprietary, we are willing to enter into a commercial license at that time. The good news is that one can start on the GPLv3 license, then transition to a commercial license later. So, here is how our licensing impacts you if your goal is commercial deployment: - You can get going today at no cost. You can experiment all you want. You can create an application. - As you get ready to launch your application, you will have two choices: 1. First, you can distribute it under the GPL, which requires that you release source code. This option can work for commercial deployments if you have other value-added products or services that you can charge for, such as support or integration services, or product modules that are not based on the open source. 2. Alternatively, you can request a commercial license from us, which would allow you to create a proprietary product. I realize you might want to know the terms of that commercial license now, rather than wait. But, the truth is, we don t have such a commercial license today. We are committed to creating one, but it must be driven by the needs of the developers, rather than created as an abstract thought process. Once we have a real deployment to consider, then we can craft a license that is appropriate. You might ask, but can t we just require something unreasonable at that time? How can you trust us? Well, all I can say about this is that it is in our best interests to negotiate a reasonable license. It does us no good to license people who fail. We want to license people who succeed. As such, our interests are entirely aligned. Once you know what product you re creating, the target market, the price point, the potential volumes, etc., we can work with you to put together a license that makes sense for both of us. I feel this structure can work well for the independent developer. You have no out-of-pocket up-front costs or commitments, so you can work on your ideas with little risk. Once you have something that you think is exciting, you have the freedom to explore multiple business models. If at that point, the proprietary business model is best for your goals, you will have enough info to share with us so that together we can create an appropriate license.

And here it is! Here s how it works. Our community comes up with an idea list of projects that potential SoN students might work on. Each idea must have a mentor assigned to it before it is approved, but unapproved issues are still kept around so students may base their proposals on them as well. Student proposals based on approved ideas with pre-assigned mentors have a better chance of being accepted. Once the idea list is ready, student registration is opened up so interested parties can submit their proposals. They may be based on the ideas in the official idea list, or students may come up with their own ideas for proposals. After the student registration is over, the SoN team reviews the applications and assigns approved proposals to mentors within the NuPIC community. Approved proposals and students are announced, and a community bonding period begins before any code is written. During this period, we welcome new students into the NuPIC community and encourage them to introduce themselves and talk about their proposals on our mailing list and IRC. The coding period is roughly three months, which includes a mid-term report submitted by the student-mentor team to the SoN Staff. This is a way for us to gauge student progress and provide additional resources if necessary. Once the coding period is complete, each student will submit a final report of the progress he/she made on the proposal, and the mentor will weigh in with his/her feedback on how the student did on the project. We will publish a final report of the progress made during the Season, including each student report and a summary of all the code submissions that made it back into NuPIC projects. After the Season is over, successful students will receive an official certificate of participation from Numenta, as well as a Season of NuPIC 2014 t-shirt. Not to mention the camaraderie and satisfaction of participating in an open source project on the bleeding edge of machine learning and cortical simulation. I m looking forward to meeting new people and introducing them to our great community of collaborators, scientists, and dreamers. If you are interested in participating in NuPIC, but you don t know where to start, please take a look through the Season of NuPIC 2014 Idea List. Student registration ends April 1 2014!

Specifically, it can accept GPS track information in GPX format and output indications of anomalous activity for each point along the tracks. This could be useful for a number of interesting applications: - Air Safety Monitor location, speed and trajectory of commercial aircraft - Monitor location, speed and trajectory of commercial aircraft - Maritime Domain Awareness Detect abnormal ship routes or unexpected ports of entry Spot unexpected travel impediments weather, malfunctions, piracy - Detect abnormal ship routes or unexpected ports of entry - Spot unexpected travel impediments weather, malfunctions, piracy - Family and Pet Care Receive alerts when family members deviate from normal routes or locations Track teen driving patterns and speeds - Receive alerts when family members deviate from normal routes or locations - Track teen driving patterns and speeds - Fleet and Professional Driver Tracking Monitor driver route and activity compliance Collect anomalous route data to understand traffic conditions or road obstructions - Monitor driver route and activity compliance - Collect anomalous route data to understand traffic conditions or road obstructions - Personnel Compliance and Safety Monitor employee movements in hazardous industries - mining, public safety, military Ensure service coverage - security guards, hospitality workers, sales associates - Monitor employee movements in hazardous industries - mining, public safety, military - Ensure service coverage - security guards, hospitality workers, sales associates - Supply Chain Visibility Monitor inventory movement through supply chains to identify anomalies and delays Spot new bottlenecks or service disruptions in delivery networks - Monitor inventory movement through supply chains to identify anomalies and delays - Spot new bottlenecks or service disruptions in delivery networks You can see a simple tutorial of how to import GPS information from standard GPX files in this video: Numenta has also authored a white paper entitled Geospatial Tracking: Learning the Patterns in Movement and Detecting Anomalies, which provides details about our motivation, potential use-cases, and underlying technologies. At the heart of this new capability is the GeospatialCoordinateEncoder, which converts geospatial coordinate information into a format that is compatible with NuPIC, exposing the characteristics of location information that allows the cortical underpinnings of NuPIC to understand it. In a way, this is analogous to providing a new sense of location awareness that we humans currently don t have. For details about how the Geospatial Coordinate Encoder works to encode this data for NuPIC, see the following video by Numenta engineer Chetan Surpur: We hope this demonstration of NuPIC s geospatial tracking capabilities inspires others to create more interesting implementations in the fields listed above.

Kevin Martin Jose I regard following the progress of Numenta as the most interesting news available. I wish to someday implement a version of Nupic in a consumer product. Dave Petrillo I discovered Jeff from his Triangulation interview back in April and have been hooked ever since. Ryan Belcher I d say the only thing I don t really understand about HTM is why there is not even more widespread interest for it from the AI community. Angela Bovo I was one of the season-of-nupicers this year which was pretty interesting. I made an experimental visualisation library for NuPIC. Which i hope to properly release soon. Ruaridh O Donnell I have developed a good intuition for the characteristics of our brain and central nervous system as models for IT simulations and the CLA, HTM, SDR concepts together are very brilliant and worth their weight in gold. As it turns, I also apply some data science to some of the data in our systems and I believe that GROK may one day be a good solution for some future applications.

It was a 36-hour event, starting at 10AM on Saturday, and ending with hack demos at 4PM Sunday afternoon. We started with a Kickoff presentation to go over hackathon protocol, then jumped right into hacking. There were some interesting themes this time. A lot more people tried using cortical.io s word fingerprinting service for natural language processing hacks. We also had a lot of interest in EEG analysis with NuPIC, which seems to be a hot topic within the community. And we even had another robotics demo! I think I say this after every NuPIC hackathon we host, but this hackathon was the best one yet! We had well over 50 participants, 16 demos, and a ton of fun and community bonding. It was really nice to see some new faces at this hackathon. I love meeting the people of our community! Watch Video on YouTube. Once again, we had attendees from all over the world: Amsterdam, China, Austria, Ireland, not to mention from all over the United States. I was really impressed how with each hackathon our community gets a better understanding of NuPIC and how it can be used to tackle many different kinds of problems. Even though we had a high percentage of new hackers this time, I could really see the light bulbs turning on as I talked to people about their hackathon ideas.

We were really impressed with the types of things hackers attempted to perform with NuPIC. When we have hackathons, it s a chance for people interested in NuPIC and HTM to push the boundaries of HTM technology and really see what it might be capable of. I always come away inspired and excited about the future of NuPIC and HTM, and this hackathon was no exception at all. Not all hacks are success stories, but each one is a learning experience.

A sincere thank you to all who have participated on our mailing lists, our code repositories, and our hackathons. You folks are the reason we ve gone open source, and the reason we continue to thrive. I see a bright future for us, and I truly believe we will lead the path forward to truly intelligent machines built on neocortical principles. It s not an easy road, but you are the pioneers helping us pave it for the masses that will follow. I had a wonderful time interacting with all of you, and I look forward to even more ground-breaking work at the next hackathon in Spring 2015. Thanks to Jeff Fohl for the excellent logo design! By the way! You can see all the videos and photos taken at every hackathon on our YouTube channel and Flickr page.

I am introducing a nice tool for the NuPIC community. NuPIC Studio is a powerful all-in-one tool that allows users create an HTM network from scratch, train it, collect statistics, and share it among the members of the community. It is not just a visualization tool but an HTM builder, debugger and laboratory for experiments. It is ideal for newbies with little intimacy with NuPIC code as well as experts that wish for better productivity. Among its features and advantages are: - Users can open, save, or change their HTM projects or of other developers. A typical project contains data to be trained, neural network configuration, statistics, etc, which can be shared to be analyzed or integrated with other projects. - The HTM engine is the own original NuPIC library (Python distribution). This means no port, no bindings, no re-implementation, etc. So any changes in the original NuPIC source can be immediately viewed. This helps users that wish to test improvements like new encoders or even hierarchy, attention, and motor integration. - Source code of the HTM network architecture is automatically generated in order for users to simply copy and paste it into their applications and so consume NuPIC Network API. - The project is pip-installable and for desktop use. The project s site is: https://github.com/nupic-community/nupic.studio Enjoy!

Wed, Dec 03, 2014 BlogHTM in Java! Matthew Taylor Open Source Manager Introducing the feature-complete htm.java project! Thanks to a lot of effort by David Ray, the NuPIC hacker community, and Numenta s own development staff, a fully usable version of NuPIC (minus swarming and OPF functionality coming soon!) is now available in Java. This port is 100% functionally equivalent to NuPIC s Network API. See the complete javadocs here! Bringing NuPIC to Java is an important milestone in NuPIC technology due to the size and significance of Java s user base. Because Java is the world s most used programming language, HTM now has the advantage of being exposed to an extraordinary amount of new developers and users. htm.java is easy to setup and configure, and because the JVM is such a common runtime, that means instant availability on platforms like Windows and all Linux flavors without the use of a virtual machine (not to mention mobile devices!) The community is fully committed to adding all the support tools and infrastructure the Python version enjoys, and those are the next milestones to be worked on. There is already a \"HelloSP\" example created by a community member. Here is the constructor: /** * * @param inputDimensions The size of the input. {m, n} will give a size of m x n * @param columnDimensions The size of the 2 dimensional array of columns */ HelloSP(int[] inputDimensions, int[] columnDimensions) { inputSize = 1; columnNumber = 1; for (int x : inputDimensions) { inputSize *= x; } for (int x : columnDimensions) { columnNumber *= x; } activeArray = new int[columnNumber]; parameters = Parameters.getSpatialDefaultParameters(); parameters.setParameterByKey(KEY.INPUT_DIMENSIONS, inputDimensions); parameters.setParameterByKey(KEY.COLUMN_DIMENSIONS, columnDimensions); parameters.setParameterByKey(KEY.POTENTIAL_RADIUS, inputSize); parameters.setParameterByKey(KEY.GLOBAL_INHIBITIONS, true); parameters.setParameterByKey(KEY.NUM_ACTIVE_COLUMNS_PER_INH_AREA, 0.02*columnNumber); parameters.setParameterByKey(KEY.SYN_PERM_ACTIVE_INC, 0.01); parameters.setParameterByKey(KEY.SYN_PERM_TRIM_THRESHOLD, 0.005); sp = new SpatialPooler(); mem = new Connections(); parameters.apply(mem); sp.init(mem); } And here is the usage: public static void main(String args[]) { HelloSP example = new HelloSP(new int[]{32, 32}, new int[]{64, 64}); // Lesson 1 System.out.println(\" Following columns represent the SDR\"); System.out.println(\"Different set of columns each time since we randomize the input\"); System.out.println(\"Lesson - different input vectors give different SDRs \"); //Trying random vectors for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) { example.createInput(); example.run(); } //Lesson 2 System.out.println(\" Identical SDRs because we give identical inputs\"); System.out.println(\"Lesson - identical inputs give identical SDRs \"); for (int i = 0; i < 75; i++) System.out.print(\"-\"); System.out.print(\"Using identical input vectors\"); for (int i = 0; i < 75; i++) System.out.print(\"-\"); System.out.println(); //Trying identical vectors for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) { example.run(); } // Lesson 3 System.out.println(\" Now we are changing the input vector slightly.\"); System.out.println(\"We change a small percentage of 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.\"); System.out.println(\"The resulting SDRs are similar, but not identical to the original SDR\"); System.out.println(\"Lesson - Similar input vectors give similar SDRs \"); // Adding 10% noise to the input vector // Notice how the output SDR hardly changes at all for (int i = 0; i < 75; i++) System.out.print(\"-\"); System.out.print(\"After adding 10% noise to the input vector\"); for (int i = 0; i < 75; i++) System.out.print(\"-\"); example.addNoise(0.1); example.run(); // Adding another 20% noise to the already modified input vector // The output SDR should differ considerably from that of the previous output for (int i = 0; i < 75; i++) System.out.print(\"-\"); System.out.print(\"After adding another 20% noise to the input vector\"); for (int i = 0; i < 75; i++) System.out.print(\"-\"); example.addNoise(0.2); example.run(); } Running this example code prints out the resulting SDRs to the console like this: Now we are changing the input vector slightly.

It shows that the NuPIC community contains a full and vibrant user base that is very committed to the success of NuPIC and HTM technologies. The development of the Java version by the NuPIC community also validates the choice of making NuPIC open source, showing that its community desires a fully compliant version of NuPIC that is easy to manage, install and widely applicable. Want to get involved? Are you a Java programmer interested in neocortically-inspired machine intelligence? Check out the htm.java road map and find out where we need help. Create some sample applications and get your feet wet with HTM on the JVM. Thanks On a personal note, I d like to give a big thank you to David Ray. He came to us earlier this year with a plan for this Java port and the full intention of giving the codebase over to Numenta for management. Over the past several months, he has worked tirelessly reading the NuPIC codebase and painstakingly creating Java versions of all our algorithms. Congratulations to David for reaching this milestone and creating a complete port of NuPIC.

It s also true that in order to arrive, one must have departed from someplace (duh! :-P). In software optimization, knowing where it is one came from, (and establishing baselines), is a very large part of the battle; and the same things that make Java such an attractive and ubiquitous platform, also make it one of the hardest environments to benchmark. Unlike C, which is a statically compiled language, Java is very dynamic and undergoes very aggressive optimization and runtime profiling while it compiles down to native code on the fly! As such, there are many pitfalls one can come across when benchmarking Java code; which is why JMH was chosen for HTM.java s benchmark tool. JMH was developed as part of the OpenJDK project (the incubator Oracle draws from to create their official JDK), and while it doesn t make benchmarks infallible, it will help surmount some of the hardest issues benchmarking Java can present (such as accounting for optimizations: see Loop Unrolling, Dead Code Elimination, and Escape Analysis). For more detailed information about benchmarking Java please watch: the talk by Aleksey Shipilev, it s a crucial and informative watch. Uhm Back to HTM.java, right? Right! :) HTM.java s new benchmarking package is not the end of the road - it is just the beginning. It is a place to depart (using the previously established vernacular). The package can be found in the \"src/jmh/java\" directory, and is comprised of 4 classes to start off with: - AbstractAlgorithmBenchmark - Base class containing basic setup boilerplate code necessary to initialize the NuPIC algorithms. - SpatialPoolerGlobalInhibitionBenchmark - Loops through 7 encoded (days of the week) inputs multiple times using the global inhibition parameter of the SpatialPooler set to true. It is not a benchmark of a single compute call or micro benchmark , it is set in place in order to detect crucial changes in performance during builds. (The same goes with the following two benchmarks). - SpatialPoolerLocalInhibitionBenchmark - Same as above except with the global inhibition flag set to false. - TemporalMemoryBenchmark - Exercises the TemporalMemory using the 7 SDR s obtained from the SpatialPooler output (though it is stand alone and can be run by itself), performing the same loop as the SpatialPooler benchmarks. Gradle Build Integration The build.gradle file, is configured to run the above benchmarks (they only take one minute) during Travis CI, continuous integration builds. Fun Fact: The SpatialPooler benchmark is run 1000 times for the warm up and 1000 times for the timing run ; likewise the TemporalPooler is run 45,000 times for each) A lot can happen in one minute! These can also be run on the command line using: - gradle check - Will build the sources and then run the benchmark at the end of the build run. - gradle -Pskipbench check - Will skip the benchmark run at the end of the build (for those times when you simply want a quick check of the build). Human readable results can be found in: \"<git source dir>/build/reports/jmh/human.txt\". The jar file created by the gradle check command can be found at: \"<source dir>/build/libs/htm.java-0.40-jmh.jar\". The following command can be executed (from inside the <source dir>/build/libs directory) to simply run the benchmarks after gradle check has been run at least once. java -jar htm.java-0.40-jmh.jar The 0.40 part of the file name may change when new versions of HTM.java are released. You can contribute too! In addition, any classes found in the src/jmh/java directory will be automagically run during gradle check . The src/jmh/java directory was chosen by the author of the jmh gradle plugin as a means of allowing the integration of benchmarks into any project without having to create a separate project directory structure. (Big Kudos to Cedric Champeau) Thanks! In addition, there is a text file located here entitled jmh_defaults.txt which lists all the jmh command line flags the gradle plugin supports - for your convenience! Happy Benchmarking!

( and otherwise affiliated) :-) We re [ insert understatement here ] excited? to announce the completion of the Network API (NAPI) for the Java port of NuPIC. This addition to HTM.java will usher in a whole new realm of possibilities for application integration and for streaming data applications. Stream of consciousness you say? Maybe someday :-) For now let us be content with easy integration of Numenta s learning, prediction, and anomaly detection algorithms into new forward-thinking Java applications; distributed data applications; and enterprise ecosystems. Until now, Java users of NuPIC had to be content with piecing together individual algorithmic components by supplying their own duct-tape, stitching and glue. This is no longer necessary, as the NAPI is very robust; has lots of features, and most importantly - is hypnotizing-ly easy to work with! Here s an example of the code it takes to get a full featured network up and running: Parameters p = NetworkDemoHarness.getParameters(); p = p.union(NetworkDemoHarness.getNetworkDemoTestEncoderParams()); Network network = Network.create(\"Network API Demo\", p) .add(Network.createRegion(\"Region 1\") .add(Network.createLayer(\"Layer 2/3\", p) .alterParameter(KEY.AUTO_CLASSIFY, Boolean.TRUE) .add(Anomaly.create()) .add(new TemporalMemory()) .add(new SpatialPooler()) .add(Sensor.create(FileSensor::create, SensorParams.create( Keys::path, \"\", ResourceLocator.path(\"rec-center-hourly.csv\")))))); network.start(); and that s it! For less ear-chattering and more quick-starting , see the Quick Start Guide & Docs. Decided to stick around eh? Well, since you re here, let s talk more about how the NAPI is designed and a bit more about its features. In HTM.java, the hierarchical entities seek to provide corollaries to actual biological structures. A Network can be thought of like a single neocortex, while a Region can be thought of as a location in the neocortex that is sensitized to a particular function, behavior or memory. Lastly, Layers are metaphors for actual layers in the neocortex such as the 6 layers identified by neurological researchers. Thus, in HTM.java, the Layer is the container for the Connections object and eventually will hold the column/cell matrix that the Connections object now holds. (Hint!: Work to be done here). The SpatialPooler and TemporalMemory describe how connections are formed and their associations, and algorithmic data flow - but are not physical members of a hierarchy - they describe how data flows. At the top level there is the Network. A Network is a container of Regions, which in turn contain Layers, which in turn contain Columns, Cells, Dendrites and Synapses - and are acted upon by the different algorithms (i.e. SP, TM etc.). A Network can be both listened to and it can have data submitted to it. In fact, this is its normal usage pattern. Regions are collections of Layers. While they are not an optional construct within a Network, they also don t do all that much. Regions are best thought of as groups of algorithmic hierarchies that may in the future, specialize on types of knowledge or types of behavior or other functionality. They are here mostly to provide a corollary to Regions in the neocortex - but mostly they are meant to identify and distinguish layers of functionality specialized for a particular purpose. The last level in the hierarchy is the Layer. Layers contain the column/cell matrix (Connections) and house all the algorithmic and functional components. This is where the heart of the NAPI beats. Layers house most of the functionality - automatically forming computational units implemented via RxJava Observables which know how to connect one algorithm to another, transforming its data in the process in order to input data to the next succeeding algorithm (whatever it may be) in the format that that algorithm expects. Layers emit Inference objects when subscribed to (either via their Layer.subscribe() method or by retrieving their Observable<Inference> object, and calling Observable.subscribe() on it); and may have data directly submitted to them via the onNext() method of their Observable. To retrieve their Observable, simply call Layer.observe() which returns an Observable<Inference> object. While the Layer object is flexible enough to function this way, the typical usage pattern will be to create a Network object (with a Sensor connected at the bottom), start it; then subscribe to it via its Observable (Network.observe()), in order to receive its emitted Inference objects. All hierarchy objects may be listened to by calling (Network.observe(), Region.observe(), or Layer.observe() / Layer.subscribe()). The Inference object emitted contains a vast amount of information such as the predicted columns, the previously predicted columns, the activated columns etc. In addition data may be retrieved from a given Layer following each cycle also. Usage (A bit of FRP) First, as you can see above, entire networks can be constructed using the \"fluent\" style of declaration (all one method call chain). This reduces boilerplate typing and clarifies the hierarchical structure of the api s constructs. Secondly, the whole framework is designed with Streaming data and Asynchronous usage in mind. The network s Sensors were implemented using the Java 8 Streams API and will be totally asynchronous ready when work on the various Encoders is completed to make them thread safe. HTM.java s Stream usage has been customized to include batching of input - speeding up parallel processing by up to 30 or 40%. The BatchedCsvStreamBenchmark test class can be run as a demonstration. (Your mileage may vary.) Finally, the RxJava Reactive Extensions library was used throughout to simplify the connection of algorithms within a Layer. Think about it Each Layer can contain one or more components, and it is unknown which ones will exist in any given Layer. Next, these components all output different data and take in different data in different combinations. So a framework that allows for all of this must be adaptable and able to transform data based on the dynamic existence or non-existence of any particular algorithm or component! Additionally, because at all levels (except the bottom input level), Inference objects are passed between components, layers and regions; RxJava Observables can be obtained at any point in the hierarchy, and subscribed to to receive output data --or-- they can be combined, operated upon and manipulated in Map-Reduce form! How exciting is that? This means that you can take output from any point and operate on it (combine, zip, merge, delay etc.) in your own applications using RxJava idioms! A bit about input / output (FEED ME!) This is discussed in more detail in the wiki linked below, but we just wanted to touch on this briefly. Networks can be fed either by connecting them to receive streaming data \"automatically\" by declaring a FileSensor or URLSensor. Additionally you can call Layer.compute() directly with either an int[], String[] (not fully implemented), Map (like an encoder mapping), or ManualInput object. Lastly, you can use an ObservableSensor to either feed in data manually/programmatically or connect to other Observable emitters within your applications! ManualInput objects inherit from Inference (the interface received on output and passed between layers, regions, and other components) At the other end, Networks can be subscribed to in order to receive data \"out of the top\" (And so can Regions, and Layers - see Region.observe() and Layer.observe() ). Here s a brief look at the Observable interface s simplicity: Observable<Inference> o = network.observe(); // This Observable can be used a million different ways! o.subscribe(new Subscriber<Inference>() { @Override public void onCompleted() { // Do finalization work here if desired } @Override public void onError(Throwable e) { // Error handling here } @Override public void onNext(Inference i) { // Called on every cycle of the Network - work is done here } }); Where do I fit in? Now that the ground work has been laid, there is a TON of things to do!

This includes the code for our most recent product, HTM for Stocks, and it also includes an extremely useful utility for running many anomaly detection models simultaneously called HTM Engine. The HTM Engine can be a bit tricky to get running by yourself, so I created a tutorial screencast that shows how you can build your own client program that uses the HTM Engine in any programming environment you like. This screencast showcases a prototype JavaScript application I wrote that pulls live traffic speeds from 153 routes in and around New York City and feeds them into NuPIC models simultaneously. I hope you find this screencast useful. Please let me know if you have any troubles getting it running by emailing at matt@numenta.org, or just send your message to the nupic-discuss mailing list.

First, effective today, we will be using the AGPL open source license instead of the GPL open source license for all of our open source software. When we made the decision to use the GPLv3 license several years ago, the GPL seemed like a good fit for our needs as we were trying to promote a community that shares their work, rather than going with a more permissive style license that allows individuals to keep enhancements private. The AGPL is in keeping with that spirit and makes clear that use in a SaaS implementation is also considered a distribution and thus must fully comply with the GPL. The proposed changes were discussed on our mailing lists and the NuPIC community is supportive of this change. Note that the AGPLv3 is explicitly designed to be the same as the GPLv3 with the additional of the SaaS clarification, and will not impact open source developers in any other way. Second, we have heard from potential customers that some companies have prohibitions against their engineers using either the GPL or the AGPL. Consequently, we have created a very simple Trial License. The Trial License confers no commercial rights, but allows research and experimentation with NuPIC software without being required to use an open source license. Finally, as you may know, we have a dual license strategy for NuPIC in that we offer commercial licenses in addition to our open source license. Recently, we have had an increase in requests for commercial licenses to the point where we would like to create a standard licensing program. We are in the process of documenting this program to be released in the next few weeks. We plan on having two types of license, one geared towards start-up companies formed specifically to create HTM applications (with no up-front payments and a delayed royalty stream), and the other for established companies. We hope these will cover the majority of cases but of course, we can create custom licenses as needed. I believe that these license changes will have a positive impact both for the NuPIC open source community as well as for potential commercial partners. Other than the SaaS change, there is no other change in the open source license such that researchers, students, and individual programmers can continue their work as before. Commercial participants can use our Trial License, and will soon be able to evaluate our new standard licenses. Thank you for your continued support.

Overall, this has been a great time for me and lots of others involved. We ve grown together and created some really interesting things! The one consistent complaint I ve gotten from hackathon attendees is that there just wasn t enough time to complete their projects. We ve been listening to you So it s time to up the ante! The Challenge The Numenta HTM Challenge is an online contest that starts today and runs util November 14th. Participants must come up with ideas for real-world applications of HTM technology and submit them for approval before starting work. This ensures the problem you re trying to solve is applicable to HTM, and that the data being analyzed is adequate for HTM. Once your project has been approved, you ll have until November 6th to work on it and submit a demo video for judging (that s 49 days from today!). Onsite Event Nov 14 This Challenge can be completed entirely online, but we encourage you to try to attend the Onsite Event that culminates the Challenge on November 14 in Redwood City, California. At this Onsite Event, all demonstration videos will be viewed by a judging panel and a live audience. Judges will get a chance to comment and ask questions to submission authors (either live or over the phone). At the end of the event, we ll announce the winners and cash prizes will be awarded! In addition to judging, there will also be at least two educational sessions by Numenta team members Subutai Ahmad and Jeff Hawkins. They will be talking about the history and evolution of HTM algorithms and some details about new algorithm development, respectively. You don t have to participate in the Challenge to attend the Onsite Event! Maybe you just want to come see the latest presentations from Numenta or watch the Challenge demonstration judging. That s great! We welcome you to mingle with us HTM enthusiasts. RSVP for the Onsite Event here Community Meetup Nov 13 And as long as you ll be in the area, there is a Community Event being planned on the Friday before the Onsite Event. I hope you ll attend just to meet the rest of the HTM community. This event is run by the NuPIC community, for the NuPIC community. A schedule is in the works. RSVP for the Community Meetup here Help us build the future of Machine Intelligence! We believe that HTM is the future of machine intelligence.

Many of us have asked What is the math behind the SP? or How can I use the SP for machine learning . The goal of this paper is to address those very questions, bridging the gap between HTM and the machine learning community. This work is part of a much larger body of work being conducted by the Rochester Institute of Technology s (RIT s) NanoComputing Research Lab. Our lab is specifically focused on designing energy efficient hardware circuits and architectures that are biologically inspired. One of our key strengths is the utilization of emerging technologies such as memristors to design energy efficient neuromorphic systems. So why is a hardware group interested in mathematical models?! To properly design hardware, it is imperative to build on a key mathematical model of the overarching system. If we are able to do so, we could potentially produce a hardware design of HTM that not only has higher performance than a software-based solution, but also consumes much less power. We are currently working on such a system, so please follow our work. It is widely known that the SP is similar to a self-organizing map (SOM). Our paper takes that idea farther, by showing that the primary learning mechanism consists of a component that is very similar to competitive learning. In fact, we posit that the SP is not a competitive learning network, but rather many competitive learning networks. In this construct, each column acts as a competitive learning network, with the columns set of inputs determined in a manner similar to attribute bagging. The final set of active columns is then determined by a voting scheme. This process can be used to explain the reasoning behind the permanence selection, but it still leaves the reasoning behind the permanence update method. Many people have posited that the permanence update rule is similar to Hebbian learning, since winning columns have their active synapses positively reinforced. While this is a nice connection, it is not sufficient for a full mathematical model. We demonstrate how the permanence update may be modeled as an optimization problem, through the use of a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE). Using this approach, it is possible to choose permanence increment and decrement amounts best suited for the application. In addition to the discussion on the primary learning mechanism, we show how the SP can be used to perform feature mapping and dimensionality reduction. A method is also provided for reconstructing the SP s representation back in the input space. We additionally provide full equations for every aspect of the algorithm (including the boosting operations), optimized for matrix computations. A discussion concerning the initialization of the network is also included. For those of you more interested in the overall system design, we have open-sourced our code (MIT License). You may download the full source from my GitHub and you may browse the fully generated API on my personal website. If you are familiar with machine learning in Python you will be happy to know that the implementation uses the scikit-learn interface. Our implementation includes support for using scikit-learn s build in cross-validation (CV) suite. We also have sample code on how to use this as a single process or as many processes locally or as a plethora of process on a cluster. It is our wish that this work helps the community to further advance the understanding and application of HTM. We are continuing this work by studying the temporal memory portion of HTM. As with all work, it is important to note any contributions. K. Gomez of Seagate Technology [10] and J. Hawkins, S. Ahmad, and Y. Cui of Numenta provided feedback on this work. Many members of the NanoComputing Research Lab (namely A. Hartung and C. Merkel) also provided critical feedback. Lastly, RIT s research computing provided the infrastructure to allow us to perform our simulations.

Welcome to the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) Competition for Real-Time Anomaly Detection at IEEE WCCI 2016 (World Congress on Computational Intelligence). About Competition Do you have an algorithm that detects anomalies in streaming data? Or a dataset of real-world, time-series data with labeled anomalies? If so, you re encouraged to enter the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) Competition. Read more on the Numenta company blog: http://numenta.com/blog/2016/02/11/numenta-anomaly-benchmark-contest-ieee-wcci-2016/ What is NAB? The Numenta Anomaly Detection Benchmark (NAB) attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. - NAB is available at: http://numenta.com/numenta-anomaly-benchmark/ - Learn More about NAB in this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03336 - NAB Video Presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxtsCrTHz-4 Why is it important? Much of the world s data is streaming, time-series data, where anomalies give significant information in often-critical situations; examples abound in domains such as finance, IT, security, medical, and energy. Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. What is the NAB competition? Numenta is conducting this competition in association with the IEEE WCCI (World Congress on Computational Intelligence). The WCCI NAB competition has two categories: 1. Algorithms: what is the best algorithm for detecting anomalies in streaming data? 2. Datasets: what is the best data contribution to the benchmark corpus? How do I enter? You may submit to either the algorithms or datasets components, or both. Please send all submissions to nab@numenta.org. Algorithms Category To enter the Algorithms category, you must submit your anomaly detection algorithm and the results of running it on NAB. Deliverables include: - Detailed description of algorithm(s), including NAB results - Code to run your algorithm and recreate the results (link to Github repository is fine) - List of contributors and contact information We will evaluate your algorithm by running your code on NAB v1.0, given it meets the requirements described above. Final results will be disclosed at the conference, and then posted to the NAB repository scoreboard. Dataset Category To enter the Dataset category, you must submit real-world, time-series data with labeled anomalies. Deliverables include: - Data file(s) in CSV format One header row Fields for timestamp (time at the end of the metric collection window) and \"value\" (the metric as either float or integer) - One header row - Fields for timestamp (time at the end of the metric collection window) and \"value\" (the metric as either float or integer) - Anomaly labels timestamps at which the anomalies start - Description of the data and anomalies We will evaluate your dataset against the following characteristics: - Meeting the requirements described above - Interesting types of anomalies - Relevance to real applications - Accuracy/quality of anomaly labels - Good challenges for detection algorithms - Quantity of data the more files in your submission the better - Feasibility for algorithms to detect anomalies We can not expect noisy data without temporal patterns to be valuable in evaluating algorithms, and thus this type of data will not be useful in NAB. - We can not expect noisy data without temporal patterns to be valuable in evaluating algorithms, and thus this type of data will not be useful in NAB. What are some example entries? We ve provided two example entries to give you an idea of what a submission in each category would look like. Dataset Category Attached with this entry are two data files of satellite data. These are station-keeping metrics for a Planet Labs Dove , an Earth-imagery cubesat[1,2] currently in orbit! The file dove_array_temp.csv contains 10,000 records of the satellite s external temperature, where the metric is degrees Celsius. The file dove_p.csv is 6,610 records of the p-axis vector (in radians); this is one axis of a 4x1 quaternion that is used to orient the spacecraft[3]. Both files have a column for timestamps in m/d/yy h:mm format, and one column for the metric values. The accompanying JSON file dove_labels.json contains anomaly labels for both of these files in the NAB format, where timestamps denote the start of each anomaly. The temperature data shows three anomalies: the first and third anomalies are fluctuations in the normal periodicity that correspond to attitude correction maneuvers as the satellite rotates in its nadir-pointing orbit[4], and the spike anomaly is where the temperature sensor has been exposed to direct sunlight. The quaternion data shows four anomalies, each representing rotational drag of the spacecraft due to the solar arrays; these are deployed like wings from the spacecraft and feel a pushing force from solar rays. Also included are plots showing the data and anomaly points.

Standard profile Reward low-FP profile Reward low-FN profile NAB score 38.3 33.3 42.0 The algorithm bags together two outlier detectors, outliers [1] and extremevalues [2], which are both open-source R packages. To bag them they are run independently, each producing a probability that a given data point is anomalous, and the mean of these probabilities is the final anomaly likelihood. Running the NAB threshold optimization step, my algorithm has a detection threshold of 0.89 for all three scoring profiles. More info, along with the open-sourced code and NAB results files, can be found in the GitHub repository[3]. This repo includes directions on how to run the R code, which will generate CSV files with anomaly detections that you can then run through the NAB scoring system.

Detections by the algorithm must be made on the fly, one record at a time. There must be no batch, or per data file, manual parameter tuning. The algorithm must be fully automated with a single set of parameters across all data files. Any further parameter tuning required by the algorithm must be done on the fly. For example, it is not possible to look through a dataset, set a threshold, and then run through the data again. (One exception to this rule is that we allow the algorithm to know the range of data values for each data file. In the NAB detector code, the min/max value of each data file is passed in automatically when each algorithm is initialized.) The algorithm treats each file independently. The algorithm is initialized from scratch for each stream using a single constant set of parameters. It is not required to use NAB code to run your algorithm, but the reported scores must have been generated using the NAB scoring code. There are several ways to do this as detailed in the NAB wiki [3]. - Any sort of look ahead is not allowed.

The algorithm lends itself well to high-speed temporal data, but it could potentially be applied to many different fields and endeavors. What s the difference between your contributor license and Apache s? Not much, really. Here s a diff. We ve also made a change to the contributor license that diverges from slightly from the Apache version, you can read more about it on our blog. What s the difference between this and your old offering? It is important to emphasize that the old and new NuPIC algorithms are completely different. This isn t an enhancement. It might be a bit confusing that we are using the same name but we figured only a few people would be aware of the old NuPIC offering. The main differences are: a) NuPIC today includes HTM whereas the old NuPIC had our previous algorithms, b) old NuPIC was tuned for vision whereas new NuPIC is tuned for our apps, and c) old NuPIC ran on Windows. Can I add an external library to NuPIC? You can add external libraries to NuPIC. They must have a license that permits proprietary use of the library. External libraries licensed under AGPL, for instance, will not be accepted. Does NuPIC implement hierarchy? Yes and no. The software architecture for hierarchies exists within the Network API of NuPIC.Core, as well as the Python client. You can create models and link them together into a hierarchy, with lower levels passing data up into higher levels. However, hierarchy is not implemented in the easier to use Online Prediction Framework. That wouldn t prevent anyone from experimenting with hierarchies themselves, however. The algorithmic mechanism for creating an effective learned spatiotemporal hierarchy using the CLA is still very much a research topic. A good mechanism for temporal pooling within a hierarchical architecture is an active area of research for Jeff and the NuPIC community. Please search our mailing list archives for discussion and proposals on that topic. What is the difference between HTM and CLA? The neocortex is the seat of intelligent thought in the mammalian brain. High level vision, hearing, touch, movement, language, and planning are all performed by the neocortex. Given such a diverse suite of cognitive functions, you might expect the neocortex to implement an equally diverse suite of specialized neural algorithms. This is not the case. The neocortex displays a remarkably uniform pattern of neural circuitry. The biological evidence suggests that the neocortex implements a common set of algorithms to perform many different intelligence functions. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a term coined by Jeff Hawkins to describe the overall space of systems that capture the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex. Many of the key properties concerning HTM algorithms were described in the book On Intelligence. These properties include continuous learning, sequence prediction, hierarchy, feedback, attention, and sensorimotor control. The HTM whitepaper introduced a new property, namely Sparse Distributed Representations (SDR). There could be many different HTM algorithms but so far no one has effectively implemented the full set of properties in a fully working system. The Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA) is a specific algorithm that covers some of the key aspects of HTM. The CLA uses SDR s, is a continuously learning system, can learn complex sequences and make temporal predictions. There are strong relationships to what is currently known about the laminar structure in a single layer of the neocortex. CLA does not cover all the properties of HTM but we believe it forms a strong foundation for a more complete implementation. Current research at Numenta is focused on temporal pooling (required for effective spatiotemporal hierarchies) and sensorimotor control. Please see some of the recent talks for more detail on these topics. 2016 NumentaTerms Privacy Sitemap Source NuPIC FAQ","title":"Numenta.org • NuPIC FAQ"},{"path":"/hierarchical-temporal-memory/","text":"Numenta.org • Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) HTM is a biologically-constrained theory of intelligence based on years of research in theoretical neuroscience.Overview For an excellent technical overview of HTM theory, read the HTM Overview chapter of our online text, Biological and Machine Intelligence.History - Creation of RNI - Founding of Numenta - Generations of our AlgorithmsHTM Today - Code implementations (link to homepage section) - What HTM Theory coversFuture of HTM - What we are/will be working on 2016 NumentaTerms Privacy Sitemap Source ","title":"Numenta.org • Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)"},{"path":"/htm-school/","text":"Numenta.org • HTM School HTM School To help you learn about our theory and technology, we have organized educational content below.

Below are descriptions of several HTM implementations currently active within our community. For detailed descriptions of HTM algorithms, see our living text, Biological and Machine Intelligence. It contains pseudocode for both the spatial pooling and temporal memory algorithms (PDFs). NuPIC , or the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing, is an HTM implementation created by Numenta and open-sourced in June 2013. This codebase is the original HTM codebase, and is architected in a way that allows algorithmic experimentation in Python, but more performant versions of HTM algorithms in C++. NuPIC Core (C++) Our C++ codebase contains all HTM algorithms written in C++, and SWiG language bindings to Python. Language bindings to other environments should be added here. This codebase exposes the Network API, which is the primary low-level interface for creating HTM systems. http://github.com/numenta/nupic.coreNuPIC (Python) The NuPIC Python codebase contains Python code implementations of HTM. Through this interface, uses may specify whether their code runs Python algorithms or the faster C++ algorithms using the Python bindings provided in nupic.core . In addition to providing Python bindings to the nupic.core Network API, this codebase also includes a higher-level client API called the Online Prediction Framework (OPF), which is tuned towards experimentation with predictions, anomaly detection, and identifying optimal model parameters (swarming). http://github.com/numenta/nupicHTM.Java While the copyright to HTM.Java was generously donated to Numenta by it's author, it is a community-created and maintained port of NuPIC algorithms into Java. This JVM runtime provides a similar experience to the NuPIC Network API, and has algorithmic parity with NuPIC. http://github.com/numenta/htm.javaComportex (Clojure) Comportex is an implementation of HTM as a Clojure library. It is not a port of NuPIC, it is a separate implementation based initially on the Numenta \"CLA white paper\" but significantly evolved. https://github.com/htm-community/comportexNext: HTM School 2016 NumentaTerms Privacy Sitemap Source ","title":"Numenta.org • Implementations"},{"path":"/","text":"Numenta.org • Bridging the Gap between Neuroscience and AI Bridging the Gap between Neuroscience and AIHierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)AboutHTM is a biologically-constrained theory of intelligence based on years of research in theoretical neuroscience.

Here you will find our open source project NuPIC (Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing), our open source project based on a theory of neocortex called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). Parts of HTM theory have been implemented, tested, and used in applications, and other parts of HTM theory are still being developed. Today the HTM code in NuPIC can be used to analyze streaming data. It learns the time-based patterns in data, predicts future values, and detects anomalies.
