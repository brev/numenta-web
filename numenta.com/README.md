# Numenta Company Website

> http://numenta.com

Source code, generators, tooling, and content for Numenta company website.
This company website is focused on our business and strategy, and is sibling to
Numenta's educational and HTM [Community](http://numenta.org) website.


## Goals

This site is an attempt to get back to the roots of a web page: *reading*.
[Inspired by](http://numenta.com/blog/2016/09/02/why-did-we-completely-change-our-website-design-the-story-behind-our-new-look/)
the classic design of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numenta), we
hope this site will be easy to read, helpful for finding information quickly,
simple to navigate, and a delight for users to interact with.

Moving from a full statically-generated multi-page website, to a single one-page
web application, is a tricky proposition. Search engine ranking can be affected,
as important internal pages and links would disappear. Navigating the user to
one of many collapsable sections on a long page can be difficult. Accessible,
legacy, and unique browsers cannot usually support the modern technology
required for single-page web applications.

To solve these challenges, while still accomplishing our goals, we have built
this as a **hybrid** website architecture. It is **both** a classic
statically-generated multi-page website, and also a modern single-page web
application. All clients load the classic static site initially, and then modern
clients will be augmented with the single-page app. This is accomplished with
the magic of ["universal" or "isomorphic" javascript](http://isomorphic.net/):
the exact same code is used to generate the static site on the server, and then
is loaded on the client to continue the app live.

[Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) is the amazing tool that helps
us accomplish all of this.

#### Lifecycle

@TODO - talk about how dynamic dev works, how builds work, trace how content
works it's way through components, pages, \_templates, html.jsx, webpack,
gatsby, etc, etc. Gatsby's docs have some of this to build on (and maybe we can
contribute back).

### Client

#### Lifecycle

##### Baseline

All browsers and clients will start by loading a classic, simple,
statically-generated, multi-page site. This guarantees that all users will
receive a decent baseline experience, especially on older, accessible, or unique
browsers. This also gives robots and search engine crawlers to have many
internal pages to link and index.

##### Advanced / Targets

After loading the baseline experience, modern clients (listed in the support
table below) will then be augmented with an advanced single-page style web
application. This lets us simulate a large single main page, with many
collapsable sections, much like Wikipedia. This also provides fast "no-refresh"
page transitions, a full client-side text search system, etc.

**Note:** *All versions are "Latest Stable" unless otherwise noted.*

## Setup

These instructions assume latest Mac OS/X with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
package manager installed. Other platforms should come up just as easily.

(If you want to contribute to our project, please fork this repo, and work from
branches in that fork.)

```shell
brew install git node
git clone git@github.com:numenta/numenta-web.git
cd numenta-web/numenta.com
npm install
```


## Scripts

| Function | `<command>` | Notes |
| -------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Build | `npm run build` | Generate static production files |
| Clean | `npm run clean` | Clean build |
| Clean Build | `npm run clean:build` | Clean Gatsby static output from `/public` |
| Clean NPM | `npm run clean:npm` | Reset npm packaging |
| Clean Test | `npm run clean:test` | Clean up after test runs (remove `/coverage` reports, etc) |
| Deploy | `npm run deploy:gh-pages` | Deploy branch `public/` build to `origin:gh-pages` |
| Develop | `npm run dev` | Develop site interactively on http://localhost:8000 |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | Check code for meeting js/css/html linting conventions |
| Serve | `npm run serve` | Builds, then Serves static output |
| Test | `npm run test` | Runs all test suites: unit, integration, web, etc. |
| Test Unit | `npm run test:unit` | Runs just Unit Tests |
| Test Unit Coverage | `npm run test:unit:cover` | Runs unit tests, generate coverage report in `coverage/` directory, and open in browser |
| Test Unit Update | `npm run test:unit:update` | Recreate out-of-date snapshots for Unit tests |
| Test Unit Watch | `npm run test:unit:watch` | Constantly Re-Runs unit tests while watching for file changes |


## Testing

Each React component (which might be shared between sites) has it's own internal
`__tests__` subdirectory, with it's own tests.

Sitewide Non-component tests, for pages, utils, wrappers, etc., exist in the
root `__tests__` directory.

To run All Tests (unit, etc):

```shell
npm run test
```

### Unit

Run only unit tests:

```shell
npm run test:unit
npm run test:unit:watch  # auto re-run on changes to test files
```

Unit tests take and use snapshots in order to perform. Make sure new or updated
snapshots are correct before committing! To update these snapshots, try running:

```shell
npm run test:unit:update
```

Run the command below to generate a Unit Test Code Coverage report, which will
be saved in your local `./coverage` directory. Your browser should automatically
open this report when the testing is finished, and the report is generated.

```shell
npm run test:unit:coverage
```


## Build

| Environment | Time  |
| ----- | -------- |
| Dynamic Development | ~20s |
| Static (Any) | ~6m |

Additional Notes:

* **Config:** Unless otherwise stated below, the `config.toml` file should have
  the default empty `linkPrefix` setting:

  ```shell
  # config.toml
  linkPrefix = ""
  ```

* **Disqus Comments:** Disqus Comments only work on Production by default, not
  under Development, Staging, etc. You can test/verify outside Prod by sending
  an override production Post URL to Disqus
  [via the component, here](https://github.com/numenta/numenta-web/blob/master/numenta.com/components/Disqus/index.jsx#L34-L40).

### Development

#### Dynamic

```shell
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

Additional Notes:

* **Static Assets:** Static assets won't load correctly from `static/assets`
  during dynamic dev, but they will be fine later on staging and production
  after static build. Try the static dev (next section below) if you need the
  static asset links to work during development.

* **Specific Local IP:** If you need to host via a specific local IP (testing on
  a VM, etc.), `gatsby` options can be passed to `npm run` like this:

  ```shell
  npm run dev -- --host 192.168.1.112 --port 8765
  # Visit http://192.168.1.112:8765
  ```

* **Search:** To get search working under local dynamic development mode, you
  first need to build the search index, and then copy the index over to where it
  will be accessible by the dev webserver:

  ```shell
  npm run build
  cp public/_searchIndex.json pages/.
  ```

#### Static

```shell
npm run serve
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

### Integration

Update Gatsby config for GitHub Pages (gh-pages) integration targets. Modify
`config.toml` and set (but DO NOT commit):

```shell
# config.toml
linkPrefix = "/numenta-web"
```

And then run an integration build:

```shell
npm run build
```

#### Personal

Push build to personal fork `origin:gh-pages` integration hosting branch:

(Note: This will remove any other gh-pages site staged on that branch).

```shell
npm run deploy:gh-pages
npm run deploy:gh-pages -- --remote origin  # same thing
# Visit http://fork.github.io/numenta-web/
```

#### Shared

Push build to shared `upstream:gh-pages` integration hosting branch:

(Note: This will remove any other gh-pages site staged on that branch).

```shell
# Deploy master branch public/ to upstream:gh-pages branch
npm run deploy:gh-pages -- --remote upstream

# Visit http://numenta.github.io/numenta-web/
```

### Staging

```shell
npm run build
# Push output to `master` branch of `NumentaCorp/numenta.com:out/` repo-path.
# Wait a few minutes for build to happen. THIS WILL CHANGE SOON.
# Visit https://staging.numenta.com
```

### Production

```shell
npm run build
# Push output to `production` branch of `NumentaCorp/numenta.com:out/` repopath.
# Wait a few minutes for build to happen. THIS WILL CHANGE SOON.
# Visit https://numenta.com
```


## Guidance

Code standards are handled by their respective linters and lint configs (for
example, see the local file `.eslintrc.json`).

### Components

* Pages and Main Sections:
  * Main Sections (pages grouped on our Wikipedia-like single-page app
    homepage) have their actual content in each pages' `pages/*/_Section.jsx`
    file
    * These main Sections are exposed as individual Pages via each pages'
      default `pages/*/index.jsx` component
  * Regular Pages (non-Main Sections) are fully contained in the usual default
    `pages/*/index.jsx` location
* Each `React` Component should return 1 small element
* Include spaces manually around React Elements in JSX with: `{' '}`
* Custom [React context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html)
  which is available:
  * `config` = Site config (see: `config.toml`)
* Make sure to use the `prefixLink()` helper function on all internal links.
  This should be handled auto-magically for you already, but if you have trouble
  with links on staging, this may be the problem.

### Content

* Markdown link target filenames with spaces must be quoted:
  `[link text]("spaces in filename.txt")`
* Markdown YAML headmatter: be careful with quotes and escaping titles, etc.
* Beware extra Markdown
  [typographer shortcuts](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable#typographer)
* Internal flat markdown auto-links (`http://numenta.com/htm-studio/`) may break
  on staging servers, use markdown style instead:
  `[http://numenta.com/htm-studio/](/htm-studio/)`
* Search Engine Optimization (SEO) notes:
  * @TODO more basics here.
  * Make sure to follow the **URL Format** notes further below.

### Links and URLs

#### URL Format

* URLs should end with `/` (slash)
* Examples of ideal URLs detailed below:
  * `http://numenta.com/`
  * `http://numenta.com/machine-intelligence-technology/`
  * `http://numenta.com/business-strategy-and-ip/#licenses`
  * etc..

#### Possible Link Situations

* @TODO list files here with lots of link/href/URL-related code. And Refactor.
* Google Analytics should be tracking `pages` and `events` for all Situations
  in the matrix below.

| Host     | Type              | .jsx Source    | .md Source     |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Internal | Path              | [View][link1]  | [View][link7]  |
| Internal | Anchor            | [View][link2]  | [View][link8]  |
| Internal | Asset (/assets/*) | [View][link3]  | [View][link9]  |
| Internal | Asset (*/.pdf)    | N/A            | [View][link13] |
| External | Path              | [View][link4]  | [View][link10] |
| External | Anchor            | [View][link5]  | [View][link11] |

### Packages

* Use exact versions for dependencies in `package.json`, no version RegExps
  please. All package changes need be exact and on purpose for build
  reproducibility. `npm` has a `--save-exact` parameter for this:
  ```
  npm install package@1.2.34 --save --save-exact
  npm install other@5.6.7 --save-dev --save-exact
  ```
* Bump version number with each changeset: `npm version patch`
* Keep packages as up-to-date as possible. Check with: `npm outdated -depth 0`
* Update and test 1 package at a time

### Styles

* `CSS Module` Composition order:

  1. Compose from Tachyons classes
  1. Compose from Site Theme classes (Numenta colors)
  1. Compose from \_local_file_custom classes
  1. Specific custom CSS overrides

  Example:
  ```css
  ._visited:visited {
    color: #1aa0db;
  }

  .iconlink {
    composes: dim from 'tachyons';
    composes: link from 'tachyons';
    composes: color-blue from '../../assets/css/theme.css';
    composes: _visited;
    opacity: 0.5;
  }
  ```
