### Talk Abstract

**Hierarchical Temporal Memory: Computing Like the Brain**

Most of today's AI technologies are extensions of ANN models that were
envisioned twenty years ago. While they have some amazing capabilities, they are
not truly intelligent. To attain truly intelligent machines, our approach is to
understand the only thing we can all agree is intelligent today: the human
brain. HTM is an AI technology that is biologically-constrained. All major
algorithms at work in an HTM system were uncovered by years of intensive
neuroscience research. In this presentation, I'll describe the major mechanism
of HTM at a high level, and lay a path towards the future of truly intelligent
machines.
