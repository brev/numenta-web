### Event Details

Numenta is a Gold Sponsor of this hackathon that seeks to bring together
programmers, developers, artists, technologists, data analysts, environmental
stewards, travel behavior experts, commuters, and others who are interested in
using technology to address our region’s transportation challenges in order to
transform how we get around the Bay Area. Participants will have the opportunity
to use data sets coming from connected cars to build apps and tools that
encourage smarter driving, safer driving, and maybe even encourage travelers to
consider alternate travel options.

Matt Taylor will give a breakout presentation and be on hand to help hackers use
HTM with their GPS data.
