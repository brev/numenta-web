### About the MLconf

The Machine Learning Conference (MLconf) began in 2012, as a partnership with
Carnegie Mellon University’s GraphLab team, to gather the thought leaders in
Machine Learning, specifically Graph Databases.  

In 2013, MLconf became a separate event, devoted to the Machine Learning and
Data Science community in San Francisco, agnostic of any tool, platform or
company. MLconf events host speakers from various industries, research and
universities to discuss recent research and application of Machine Learning
methodologies and practices. In 2014, MLconf entered NYC and Atlanta, as well as
San Francisco. In 2015, MLconf will host conferences in NYC, Atlanta, Seattle
and San Francisco, with plans to enter additional US cities in 2016, and the UK.

MLconf gathers communities to discuss the recent research and application of
Algorithms, Tools, and Platforms to solve the hard problems that exist within
organizing and analyzing massive and noisy data sets.
