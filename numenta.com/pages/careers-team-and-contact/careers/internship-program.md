2016, so you can submit an application if this time period is of interest. We
will start accepting applications for Summer 2017 on October 1, 2016.

Numenta's technical interns will get exposure to all aspects of HTM learning
algorithms and our streaming analytics platform. The commitment is for 3 to 4
months, full time. We have internship positions in the following areas:
