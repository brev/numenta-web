***IMPORTANT NOTE:*** *Numenta is unable to consider internship applications
from international applicants unless they currently enrolled in a US University,
are US Citizens, or hold a Green Card or are NAFTA (Mexican or Canadian)
citizens.*

The Research Group at Numenta is looking for outstanding PhD students or other
research scientists for internship opportunities during the Fall - Winter
2016/2017 time frame (note that we have filled our Summer 2016 positions and are
no longer accepting applications for this time period). We are looking for
candidates with expertise in Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience and/or
Natural Language Processing. Preference given to candidates with experience in
one or more of the following areas: sequence learning, natural language
processing, neuron modeling, and computational models of cortex.

The commitment is for 3 to 4 months full time (longer appointments up to one
year may be possible). Numenta's research interns will get exposure to all
aspects of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) learning algorithms, participate
in leading edge research in computational neuroscience, and get full clearance
to publish their work.


#### What you can expect to learn and how you might contribute

* The challenges of designing and implementing detailed models of cortical
  function that can be applied to real-world problems

* Gain experience solving hard problems in domains such as natural language
  processing, streaming analytics, and/or sensorimotor inference

* Participate in designing functional models of Layers 2/3, 4, 5, and 6,
  thalamocortical circuits, feedback circuits, and sensorimotor processing

* Learn how to contribute to a top open source project, and improve your
  software engineering skills

* Obtain a detailed understanding of Hierarchical Temporal Memory


#### Desired qualifications

* Currently enrolled in a MS or PhD program, or a recent graduate, or equivalent
  research experience

* Strong research background in machine learning or machine intelligence

* Strong research background in computational neuroscience

* Excellent algorithmic problem solving skills, and the ability to implement
  solutions in Python, C/C++, Java, etc.

* Established track record of publications in leading peer reviewed conferences
  and journals

* Working knowledge of HTM algorithms a plus

* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, and the ability to work in
  a team oriented environment

* A belief that the best way to build intelligent machines is to understand the
  cortex


#### How To Apply – Research Internship

Qualified applicants should send the following:

* Cover letter describing their specific interest in Numenta.

* Resume, including list of relevant course work.

* Period of the internship (typically 3 to 4 months fulltime.)

* Please email resume and cover letter to <t render="hbs">
  [{{document.email}}](mailto:{{document.email}})</t>. Numenta is an equal
  opportunity employer supporting workforce diversity.
