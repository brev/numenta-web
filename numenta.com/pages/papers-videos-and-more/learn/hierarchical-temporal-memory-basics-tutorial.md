This video tutorial follows the 2011 HTM whitepaper, and is largely obsolete.
The content of this tutorial will be replace by
[HTM School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMB0ri4qgwc) (over time).

**Note:** This video refers to the HTM learning algorithm as the Cortical
Learning Algorithm, or CLA; we have recently decided to sunset this term.
