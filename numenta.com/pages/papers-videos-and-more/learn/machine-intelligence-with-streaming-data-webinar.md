Across every industry, we are seeing an exponential increase in the availability
of streaming, time-series data. The real-time detection of anomalies has
significant practical application. Finding anomalies in such data can be very
difficult, given the need to process data in real time, and learn while
simultaneously making predictions. With the increasing variety of streaming data
sources, automated deployment—without manual parameter tuning—is also becoming
important.
