The core concepts in Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) theory were first
described in this book titled **On Intelligence**, which was written by Jeff
Hawkins with the help of Sandra Blakeslee. This book still provides background
and a great introduction to our theory, though many of the ideas in chapter 6
(“How the Cortex Works”) are currently being revised.

**Note:** This book refers to the HTM learning algorithm as the Cortical
Learning Algorithm, or CLA; we have recently decided to sunset this term as our
technology has evolved.
