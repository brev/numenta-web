title: Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) Whitepaper
type: post
---

There have been changes in our thinking, in algorithm implementation, in
terminology and in other areas since this paper was written, rendering part of
this paper obsolete. Much of this paper has been replaced by
[BAMI](/biological-and-machine-intelligence/) and the
[current white papers](/papers/), and we will continue to provide updated
material in subsequent releases of
[BAMI](/biological-and-machine-intelligence/).

#### About

At the heart of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), our machine intelligence
technology, are time-based learning algorithms that store and recall spatial and
temporal patterns. This paper describes how the learning algorithms work and
their biological mapping.

**Note:** This paper refers to the HTM learning algorithm as the Cortical
Learning Algorithm, or CLA; we have recently decided to sunset this term as our
technology has evolved.
