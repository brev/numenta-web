Over the past year, we have tested our Grok technology on a variety of
enterprise applications. Customers show substantial interest in our
technology, with proposed applications ranging from remote equipment maintenance
to power management to web advertising optimization, and many more.

Although the interest level is strong, and we conducted many tests to prove the
validity of the cortical learning algorithms, we found that it was difficult for
customers to deploy Grok. The barriers to deployment included having clean
access to data streams as well as integrating the results into existing business
processes.

Because of this experience, we decided to create a more targeted solution that
makes it far easier for customers to deploy Grok.

This product, currently under development, will monitor IT systems,
automatically figuring out whether the network is healthy or is in an anomalous
state. In essence, we are bringing deep science to the problem of
detecting anomalies in servers and server based applications. The first
version of the product is a simple-to-deploy tool focused on customers using
Amazon Web Services (AWS).

We have a few openings left for our private beta program, which will start
shortly. If you have a current AWS environment (small or large) and would
like to participate in the private beta, please send an email to
[grokbeta@numenta.com](mailto:grokbeta@numenta.com). We welcome your input and
your help in finalizing this exciting new product.

In other news, the NuPIC open source project we created in June is off to a
great start. NuPIC contains the source code to our cortical learning
algorithms, the same code used in our product Grok. We are pleased with
the number of contributors, the email discussions, and overall
interest. We are holding our second NuPIC Hackathon in San Francisco
on November 2 &ndash; 3. To sign up for the Hackathon, go to
http://numenta.org/events/. To learn more about the open source project,

Thank you for your interest in Grok and in Numenta.org. We look forward to
meeting some of you in our beta program or at the NuPIC Hackathon.
