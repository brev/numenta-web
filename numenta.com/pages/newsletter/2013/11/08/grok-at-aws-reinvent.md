**NOTE:** Numenta has [announced a strategic partnership with Avik Partners](/press/numenta-announces-licensing-of-grok-for-it-to-avik-partners.html),
please read more about the future of
[Grok for IT Analytics](http://grokstream.com).

As we wrote to you in October, we have developed an exciting product based on
our Cortical Learning Algorithms (CLA). The product, called Grok, is targeted
towards Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers. We will be showing it publicly for
the first time at the
[Amazon re:Invent Conference](http://reinvent.awsevents.com/)
next week in Las Vegas.

This may be of interest to you for two reasons.

* This is the first commercial application of the cortical learning models we
  have developed over the past few years. It is a landmark event for us and
  a step on the path towards machine intelligence.

* Some of you have expressed interest in using Grok. If you are attending
  re:Invent, we hope you will come by booth #1200, say hello, and see how we
  applied advanced cortical modeling to transform anomaly detection in computer
  servers.

Because of the capabilities of the CLA, Grok automates the process of
modeling normal behavior and identifying unusual behavior in Amazon
instances. The patterns found by Grok go well beyond those found by static
or dynamic thresholds. In addition, Grok provides a mobile client that
enables a unique ability to monitor the health of your network anytime,
anywhere. It is a remarkable product and the first showcase for the CLA.

We continue to recruit participants in our private beta program as well, so let
us know at <a href="mailto:grokbeta@numenta.com">grokbeta@numenta.com</a> if you
are interested in using Grok.

Finally, last weekend in San Francisco we held our second NuPIC Hackathon for
the open source community built around the CLA. It was a great
success. Two big themes at this event were to apply the CLA to robotics
and natural language processing. Matt Taylor, the NuPIC community
flag-bearer, put together this

We hope to see some of you at re:Invent, and look forward to getting your
feedback on Grok. We are excited about approaching the first commercial
release of a product that is based on the CLA.
