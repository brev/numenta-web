We’ve had a busy summer at Numenta. Since the launch of our first product, Grok
for IT Analytics on Amazon Web Services (AWS), we’ve created a variety of
demonstration applications to showcase the breadth of the underlying
Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) technology.  We’ve also restructured our web
site to highlight these new applications.

First, let me give you an update on our product, Grok.  We recently released
[version 1.5](http://grokstream.com) which incorporates a great new web charting
feature.  In addition, we decided to eliminate the paid version of Grok in order
to make it super easy for customers to try and to deploy Grok.  If you are
running an AWS installation but haven’t tried out Grok, you can do so
[here](http://grokstream.com).

Then, in addition to Grok, we’ve created a group of demonstration applications
to show the potential use of our core technology in a variety of areas. We’ve
published white papers on two of the demonstrations:

* [Geospatial Tracking](/assets/pdf/whitepapers/Geospatial%20Tracking%20White%20Paper.pdf):
  using 2D or 3D speed and location data, learn travel patterns and detect
  anomalies in objects or people moving through the world

* [Rogue Behavior Detection](/assets/pdf/whitepapers/Rogue%20Behavior%20Detection%20White%20Paper.pdf):
  Model human behavioral patterns to highlight anomalies in employee actions
  such as financial trading patterns, computer and device usage, and internal
  system access.

An additional demonstration application looks at anomalies in stock volume
tracking.  We are in our initial exploration of this application, but you can
read more about it in this
[blog entry](/blog/2014/07/15/detecting-anomalies-in-stock-volumes/).

Finally, we are doing some very exciting research with our partner
[Cortical IO](http://www.cortical.io/)
on using HTM to predict and classify language using semantic encoding.

We are getting more visibility for our progress as we start to showcase these
applications.  You may want to read Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat’s article
[here](http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/09/numentas-brain-research-has-taken-a-long-nine-years-but-it-starting-to-pay-off-interview/).

On August 20, Subutai Ahmad, our VP of Research will present “Understanding
Cortical Principles and Building Intelligent Machines” at the
[Cognitive Computing Forum](/events/2014/08/20/cognitive-computing-forum/)
in San Jose. If you’re interested, register using the discount code NUMENTA.

I’d like to add a welcome to Celeste Baranski, who has joined us as VP
Engineering, taking over the daily operations of our engineering group, enabling
Subutai to dedicate himself to research and writing.

Finally, we’re happy to celebrate the first anniversary of the creation of our
[NuPIC open source project](http://numenta.org/).
NuPIC interest has grown steadily, and we are pleased to see the strength and
commitment building in this community.

We will continue to update you as we build the demonstration applications into
full-featured applications and as our research efforts continue.

Thank you for your ongoing interest in Numenta.
