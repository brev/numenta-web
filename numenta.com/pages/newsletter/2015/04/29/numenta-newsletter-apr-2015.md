### Numenta Newsletter

**April 29, 2015**

Dear Numenta newsletter subscriber:

I have a lot of exciting news to share.  Rather than making the newsletter
overly long, I’ve provided links to get more information on any of these topics.

We’re pleased to let you know about the establishment of a Cortical Learning
Center at IBM, which is actively experimenting with Numenta’s technology.  You
can view what Winfried Wilcke, a senior IBM researcher,
[has to say about his work](http://digitalops.sandia.gov/Mediasite/Play/1365ba62685c4c91a1cb7143c1e321cc1d).

In the publications arena, we have posted an important paper on the mathematical
properties of sparse distributed representations. You can [read it here](/papers/).

We also have a hackathon coming up.  For the first time, we are coming to the
east coast for this hackathon:  May 30-31 in New York City.  Many of our Numenta
engineers will be attending, as well as Jeff Hawkins and Subutai Ahmad.  
[There are still spaces left](http://numenta.org/events/hackathon/2015/may/)!

We have another project brewing called the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark.  We have
found it difficult to benchmark our algorithms given how few benchmarks exist
with streaming data.  Consequently we have decided to create an open source
benchmark ourselves in the hope that it becomes an industry standard for
real-time anomaly detection.  If you are interested in this project and,
specifically, if you have some streaming data sets that you can share, please
contact us at [nab@numenta.org](mailto:nab@numenta.org).  We plan to have the
Numenta Anomaly Benchmark available around the end of the summer.  

We’ve had a lot of positive reactions to Jeff’s article on the
[reality of AI dangers](http://recode.net/2015/03/02/the-terminator-is-not-coming-the-future-will-thank-us/),
so be sure to view some of the commentary:

* [What Really Scares Tech Leaders about Artificial Intelligence](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2015/04/20/what-really-scares-tech-leaders-about-artificial-intelligence/)
* [Graph Theory Helps To Decode The AI Fears of Tech Leaders](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2015/04/21/graph-theory-helps-to-decode-the-ai-fears-of-tech-leaders/)

Lastly, we have an opening in marketing at Numenta.  If HTM and machine
intelligence is a passion of yours, and you have a strong marketing
communications background, please consider
[applying for our position](http://numenta.com/careers-team-and-contact/).

We are excited about the momentum growing behind HTM technology and hope you’ll
have a chance to review some of these developments.
