### Numenta Newsletter &mdash; May 11, 2016

We receive many requests for better documentation of our work, and as our
research has progressed, we know that some of our most popular papers are now
outdated.  As a result, we have been working for some time on creating a “living
book”, a cohesive body of documentation that provides readers with the “A to Z”
of HTM, and that can be updated as our work progresses.  I am pleased to
announce that we have released the first four chapters of this book, called
[Biological and Machine Intelligence (BAMI)](/biological-and-machine-intelligence/). We
are calling this release v.4 to represent the 4 chapters available. We include a
list of future chapters that we hope to add, as well as links to research papers
and supporting material. Material that is replaced by BAMI will be moved to the
archive section of the [learning center](/learn/) on our web site.

In addition to publishing peer reviewed papers, we hope to build on BAMI to
become the principal resource for those who want to learn about HTM.  Over time,
we will include problem sets and lecture notes, making it particularly
appropriate for academics who intend to create courses teaching HTM theory.

For those who are interested, we’ve created a twitter account called
[@NumentaBAMI](https://twitter.com/NumentaBAMI), which we will only use for BAMI
updates.  If you’d like to be alerted when we add or revise a chapter, I
encourage you to follow this account. We’ve designed BAMI such that each chapter
includes a revision history, so you will always be able to see what has changed.
We hope you find BAMI to be a useful resource, and we
[welcome your feedback and comments](https://numenta.wufoo.com/forms/biological-and-machine-intelligence-bami/).

In addition to our BAMI news, we have some exciting events coming up this month
as well. On May 12, Jeff Hawkins will be the featured guest at a
**[NeurotechX meetup in San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/NeuroTechSF/events/230385690/)**.
Co-founded by one of our engineers, [Marion LeBorgne](mailto:mleborgne@numenta.com),
NeurotechX is a non-profit organization whose mission is to build a strong,
global neurotechnology community by providing key resources and learning
opportunities.  Jeff will give a talk titled "What is Intelligence, that a
Machine Might Have Some?”  For those that are not in the Bay Area, you can watch
the event live, and ask questions in the chat room.

On May 19, Subutai Ahmad will be giving a talk titled, “Detecting Anomalies in
Streaming Data – Real-time Algorithms for Real-world Applications” at
**[Data By the Bay 2016](http://data.bythebay.io/)**. Spanning 150 talks over
5 days, Data By The Bay is a by-data engineers, for-data engineers developer and
data scientist conference. If you’re interested in attending, you
[can get a 10% discount with the code NUMENTA10](https://www.universe.com/embed/listings/BQJX8H/bookings/new?modal=1&discount_code=NUMENTA10).

Also on May 19, I will be speaking at the
**[Business Analytics Innovation Summit](https://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/business-analytics-innovation-summit-chicago-2016)**
in Chicago.  As a sponsor of this event, we will have the opportunity to
introduce and demonstrate our technology and its applications to a
business-focused audience over the course of two days.

In partner news, Cortical.io announced new releases to their products, which
include more accurate results in the comparison of text similarity. This
announcement comes on the heels of an independent academic study that concluded
Cortical.io’s Semantic Folding approach helps improve the prediction of stock
return correlations. Visit [their website](http://cortical.io) for more details.

Lastly, our Open Source Flag Bearer, [Matt Taylor](mailto:mtaylor@numenta.com),
has created a new YouTube series called
[HTM School](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3yXMgtrZmDqhsFQzwUC9V8MeeVOQ7eZ9).
Designed for the layperson, Matt breaks down the basics of various HTM topics in
bite-size videos.  If you haven’t been to HTM School, be sure to check it out.
