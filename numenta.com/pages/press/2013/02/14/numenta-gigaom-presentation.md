Numenta, a breakthrough machine intelligence company, today announced it has
been selected as one of the four Big Ideas companies to be featured at the
GigaOM [Structure:Data](http://www.structuredata.com/introducing-structure-a-new-tech-events-company/)
conference March 20-21 in New York City.  Numenta CEO Rami Branitzky will give
an on-stage introduction of Grok, the company’s first product, on March 20
at 5:20 p.m.

[Grok](http://grokstream.com) brings together Numenta’s trailblazing R&amp;D in
biologically inspired machine intelligence software with a highly scalable
infrastructure for acting on fast data. The Grok platform ingests data streams
and creates actionable predictions in real time. Grok’s automated modeling and
continuous learning capability makes it uniquely suited for fast data.

"Machine generated streaming data is exploding. It has a short half-life and is
constantly changing," said Branitzky. "To date, the focus in the area of Big
Data has been on machines to store and process data, with a short supply of data
scientists to analyze and act on it. To best leverage fast data, we believe you
must have systems that model and learn from data automatically and use the
results to drive automated actions. That’s what Grok was designed to do."

"The GigaOM editorial team hand picked four companies and speakers who embody
great ideas that are shaping our industry for the Big Ideas session, and our
editors are excited to have
[Numenta](http://gigaom.com/2013/01/29/palm-creators-brain-mimicking-software-helps-manage-the-smart-grid/)
as one," said Surj Patel, GigaOM's Vice President for Events.

Grok solutions currently are in private beta with customers in a variety of
vertical markets, including electric energy, IT management, online advertising
and finance.  Numenta recently announced EnerNOC, Inc., a leading provider of
energy management applications, as one of its first customers - entering a
partnership that couples Numenta’s Grok streaming analytics solution with
EnerNOC’s cloud-based software to create opportunities for demand response and
increased ability to detect energy efficiency faults and anomalies.
