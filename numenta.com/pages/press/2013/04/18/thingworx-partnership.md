Partnership to fully integrate Numenta’s Grok action intelligence platform with
ThingWorx connected application platform

Exton, Pa. &#8212; April 18, 2013 &#8212;
<a href="http://www.thingworx.com">ThingWorx&#0153;</a>, the provider of the
first application development platform for the connected world, and
<a href="/">Numenta</a>, a leading provider of solutions
that help companies intelligently act on machine-generated data, today announced
a partnership to create the next generation of tools for predictive maintenance.
The companies will work together to deliver advanced maintenance solutions to
enable organizations to fully leverage the troves of data being generated by
their connected machinery to achieve maximum operational efficiency and reduce
maintenance costs.

The proliferation of devices and sensors creating machine-generated data yield
enormous opportunity for automated predictive maintenance solutions. According
to leading device and network companies such as Ericsson and Cisco, the number
of connected devices and machines is expected to reach
<a href="http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/whitepapers/wp-50-billions.pdf;">50
billion devices by 2020</a>.  ARC Research estimates that Predictive Maintenance
is a global
<a href="http://www.arcweb.com/strategy-reports/2012-06-28/leveraging-predictive-maintenance-for-apm-1.aspx">$20 billion opportunity</a>.
To fully capitalize on this opportunity, ThingWorx and Numenta believe that a
new generation of maintenance solutions are required that go beyond today’s
batch-driven analytics approaches.

ThingWorx, which provides a powerful and flexible platform to rapidly deliver
customizable applications and connected solutions, is architected for this
explosion of devices and data across a range of industries. Numenta’s industry
leading biologically inspired machine intelligence technology, called
<a href="http://grokstream.com">Grok</a>, is designed to automatically
analyze data generated by these connected devices to drive actionable
predictions.  Grok ingests data streams and can detect anomalous patterns in
data streams that indicate, for example, when a machine is in an unusual state
and might fail.

"Our two companies bring a unique combination of assets to tackle problems in
real-time predictive maintenance  to help companies minimize or avoid downtime
of mission critical systems and reduce maintenance costs," said Rami Branitzky,
Numenta CEO. "Grok capabilities – especially its continuous learning and
automated modeling — are ideal for advanced, proactive monitoring of machinery
that needs to have continuous uptime. Working closely with ThingWorx’s industry
leading connected device platform and rapid development environment we are well
positioned to help transform the Predictive Maintenance market."

"ThingWorx is pleased to be able to offer plug-and-play access to the most
innovative analytic framework in the market today," said Russ Fadel, CEO and Co-
Founder of ThingWorx.  "Grok provides new capabilities for predictive
maintenance applications.  By integrating it into our platform we can eliminate
the time-consuming process of data analysis and predictive modeling and provide
customers in asset-intensive industries such as energy, oil and gas, healthcare,
and manufacturing, and equipment OEMs, with the critical analysis and actions in
order for them to operate more reliably and efficiently. We are excited to be
offering a solution that we believe  will allow companies to truly predict
machine behavior, which will enable a step change in efficiency."

As part of their collaboration, Grok has been certified as ThingWorx
Ready&#0153; and will be pre-integrated with the ThingWorx rapid application
development platform.  Further information on the combined predictive
maintenance solution will be on display at the upcoming
<a href="http://www.wbresearch.com/fieldserviceusa/home.aspx">Field Service USA</a>
event, as well as during a live webcast on April 24, 2013,

The Future of Connected Products Today</a>.
