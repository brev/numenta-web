### HTM Studio - Uncover anomalies in your streaming data

REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- [Numenta](/), Inc., a leader in machine
intelligence, today announced the release of HTM Studio for anomaly detection, a
desktop tool that makes it easy for businesses to experiment with advanced
machine intelligence algorithms to uncover anomalies in their streaming data.
Simply add numeric, time-series data files to HTM Studio and with the click of a
button, discover and visualize within minutes what anomalies can be found.

HTM Studio is based on Numenta’s HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) biologically
inspired machine intelligence technology. HTM learns time-based patterns in
unlabeled streaming data, making it ideal for prediction, classification and
anomaly detection. Because of its ability to perform continuous, unsupervised
learning, HTM can find subtle, temporal anomalies that other techniques cannot
find.

"I was impressed with the ease of use and how quickly it is to iterate on
testing a variety of data streams. The HTM was able to pick out and forecast the
needle I was interested in, within a haystack of needles,” commented early beta
tester Vaughn DiMarco, Lead Data Science Consultant at Montreal-based
VONALYTICS.

HTM Studio provides an easy way for businesses interested in using Numenta’s
technology for anomaly detection to undertake a proof of concept securely using
their own data. If HTM Studio finds interesting anomalies, then a user can do a
full implementation or deployment of HTM.

“Detecting anomalies early in streaming data can have significant value, but
it’s difficult to do. We wanted to make it easy to try HTM on your own streaming
data,” said Donna Dubinsky, CEO of Numenta. “With HTM Studio, no coding skills
are required. Parameters are automatically set. In a matter of minutes, you can
visualize anomalies in your datasets.”

For those who don’t have streaming data readily available, HTM Studio includes
pre-loaded datasets for experimentation. Sample datasets include a variety of
use cases: IoT sensors, preventative maintenance, tracking vehicles and network
servers.

The tool is available at no charge for Mac and Windows desktop systems. Go to

### About Numenta

Founded in 2005, Numenta has developed a cohesive theory, core software
technology, and numerous applications all based on principles of the neocortex.
Laying the groundwork for the new era of machine intelligence, this technology
is ideal for large-scale analysis of continuously streaming data sets and excels
at modeling and predicting patterns in data. Numenta has also developed a suite
of demonstration applications that utilize its flexible and generalizable HTM
learning algorithms to provide solutions that encompass the fields of machine
generated data, human behavioral modeling, geo-location processing, semantic
understanding and sensory-motor control. In addition, Numenta has created
[NuPIC](http://numenta.org) (Platform for Intelligent Computing) as an open
source project. [Numenta](/) is based in Redwood City, California.
