REDWOOD CITY, Calif. --([BUSINESS WIRE](http://www.businesswire.com/))--
[Numenta Inc.](/), a leader in machine intelligence technology,
today announced the newest release of
[Grok IT for Analytics](/assets/pdf/grok/resources/1.6/Grok-1.6-DataSheet.pdf).
The application, which runs on Amazon Web Services, will be featured
at the [upcoming AWS re:Invent 2014](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/),
November 11-14 in Las Vegas. Visit Numenta and see Grok in action at
AWS Booth 648.

Based on Numenta’s breakthrough Hierarchical Temporal Memory technology, Grok
monitors servers running on AWS and enables complex pattern detection, automatic
model building, and continuous learning. Grok output is displayed on a
constantly updated mobile device, enabling IT professionals to assess the health
of their systems anytime, anywhere.

The latest Grok 1.6 release features:

* A major new feature called “Annotations,” which allows sharing of information
  and collaboration among users
* Increased ability to support additional sources and formats of data
* Enhanced performance

“Grok enables IT professionals to easily spot unusual activity and to gain
immediate insights into the health of their critical IT systems. Now, with
annotations, they can more easily share these insights with colleagues, enabling
the organization to get ahead of problems before they become serious,” noted
Numenta CEO Donna Dubinsky.

Unlike other tools that rely on static thresholds or simple statistics, Grok
automatically learns complex patterns in the AWS environment, and then
identifies unusual behavior in those systems.

Key features of Grok IT for Analytics include:

* Very easy configuration and set-up
* Automatically models each metric to determine normal patterns
* Automatically identifies and ranks unusual patterns
* Continuously learns new patterns as environments evolve
* Does not require any manual threshold setting
* Notifies the user when something curious is happening
* Displays output graphically on a mobile Android device
