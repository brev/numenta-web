Numenta and Cortical.io Form Strategic Partnership

Redwood City, CA –May 14, 2015— [Numenta, Inc.](/), a leader in machine
intelligence, and [Cortical.io](http://cortical.io), an innovator in natural
language processing (NLP), are pleased to announce a strategic partnership to
create a new computing approach to understanding text.  As part of the strategic
relationship, Cortical.io has taken a broad general license to Numenta’s
Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) technology, and Numenta has taken an
ownership position in Cortical.io.  The combination of Cortical.io’s Semantic
Folding technology and Numenta’s HTM technology enables a host of exciting
applications that have challenged computer scientists for decades, including
sentiment analysis, automatic summarization, semantic search, and conversational
dialogue systems.

“Cortical.io’s Semantic Folding technology is a clever and elegant way to feed
natural language into our HTM technology“, said Jeff Hawkins, founder of
Numenta.  “Cortical.io takes advantage of the semantic encoding and predictive
modeling of HTM systems in a way that will lead to significant advances in
natural language processing.”

“Natural language understanding is one of the central problems of artificial
intelligence,” said Francisco Webber, founder and CEO of Cortical.io.  “We aim
to build the next generation of NLP, Language Intelligence, and in so doing,
show the path to broadly applied machine intelligence.”

Building on their existing commercial product, the Retina API, Cortical.io will
make the combined technologies available through their industrial-grade cloud
service for customers ranging from innovative startups to international
corporations.  

#### About Numenta

[Numenta, Inc.](/), was founded in 2005 to be a leader in the emerging field of
machine intelligence. Numenta builds technology that helps companies
automatically and intelligently act on machine generated data.  Its biologically
inspired machine learning technology is based on a theory of the neocortex first
described in co-founder Jeff Hawkins’ book,
[On Intelligence](/learn/on-intelligence.html). Its first commercial product,
called [Grok](/grok/), offers a breakthrough solution for
anomaly detection for IT Operations. In addition, Numenta has created
[NuPIC](http://numenta.org) (Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing) as an
open source project (http://numenta.org). Numenta is based in Redwood City,
California.

#### About Cortical.io

Headquartered in Vienna, Austria, [Cortical.io](http://cortical.io) is a
science-based start-up that has developed a fundamentally new approach to
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Semantic Folding, inspired by the latest
findings on the way the human neocortex processes information.  By representing
language with highly efficient semantic fingerprints, the Retina API is the
first semantic engine that painlessly handles the avalanche of text data
experienced by global business today –in any language and in real-time. A US
subsidiary has been incorporated recently.
