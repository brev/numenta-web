### An Easy Way to Experience HTM Machine Learning Technology

Redwood City, CA –July 8, 2015— [Numenta](/), Inc., today announced the
availability of HTM for Stocks, the newest example application showing how
[Hierarchical Temporal Memory](/machine-intelligence-technology/) (HTM) technology can be
applied to streaming data and the Internet of Things.  

HTM for Stocks is a mobile application that continually monitors stock price,
stock volume, and Twitter activity for hundreds of publicly traded companies.
HTM for Stocks learns the normal patterns for each company and notifies you if
something unusual is happening to any of the companies.  

During the past two years, Numenta has created a series of example applications
to illustrate the capabilities of HTM.  The first application, Grok for IT
Analytics, uses HTM to detect anomalies in AWS server metrics and is available
at http://grokstream.com. Numenta also published example source code that uses
HTM to detect anomalies in human behavior and in GPS tracking data.  

“HTM for Stocks is our most accessible demonstration of Numenta HTM
technology,” said Numenta CEO Donna Dubinsky. “Until now, it has required
programming expertise to experience HTM-based anomaly detection. With HTM for
Stocks, it is as simple as downloading the app to your smartphone from the
[Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numenta.taurus).”

In keeping with its mission to be a technology provider, Numenta is providing
the source code for HTM for Stocks under an open source license at:
https://github.com/numenta/numenta-apps.  Said Dubinsky, “We encourage
developers to use the HTM for Stocks code to create derivative products that
track a variety of data streams. HTM for Stocks shows how thousands of data
streams can be made useful in a mobile application using HTM technology.”

### How HTM for Stocks Works

HTM for Stocks applies Numenta’s HTM modeling and anomaly detection to 200
large capitalization public companies.  It automatically models three data
streams for each company:  stock volume, stock price, and Twitter volume.  The
HTM models learn continuously, receiving new data every five minutes.  HTM
learns what is “normal” for each of the data streams for each company.  The
companies are ranked from the most anomalous to the least anomalous over the
previous hour. HTM for Stocks lets you see the text of the Tweets as well,
often explaining why the company is showing an anomaly.
