          Because we want our technology to be broadly adopted, we make it
          widely accessible in an open source community. There you’ll find our
          algorithms, daily research, source code, and an active discussion
          forum with HTM community members covering a variety of topics.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          You’ll also find our implementation of HTM theory, called NuPIC
          (Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing), which is written in C++
          and Python. Other implementations have been ported from NuPIC into
          other languages by community members.
