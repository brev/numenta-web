title: How does HTM Studio determine what is anomalous?
---

HTM Studio first learns patterns in your data and builds a model to predict what
is likely to happen in the next CSV record. Based on these predictions, the HTM
algorithm generates an anomaly score for each data point. If you would like to
learn more about anomaly detection, please refer to our
[Science of Anomaly Detection White Paper](http://numenta.com/assets/pdf/whitepapers/Numenta%20White%20Paper%20-%20Science%20of%20Anomaly%20Detection.pdf).
