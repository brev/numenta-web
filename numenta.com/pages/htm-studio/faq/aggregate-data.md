title: What does "aggregate my data" mean?
---

HTM Studio determines how much to aggregate the input records (or not at all)
before feeding them into the HTM model. Generally, aggregating noisy data will
reduce the amount of noise and help the HTM model learn faster. Aggregation
means that multiple values will be combined over an aggregation period using the
aggregation method, sum or average.
