It was Thursday night, March 20th, at 8pm. I was cleaning up the kitchen and
getting ready to wind down when my smartphone buzzed: Grok had sent an alert.
I know that with Grok it just takes a few seconds to check things out, kind of
like text messages.  So I clicked on the notification and looked at the graph.
What followed was interesting and eye opening!

It turns out that on that night Amazon’s East coast datacenter, US-East-1, had
some problems. AWS API call latencies slowly increased. Eventually by about 8:40
PM API calls were so slow as to be practically unusable.   Any applications on
those servers relying on the AWS API were unusable.

Below are two screen shots from the Grok mobile application showing the Hourly
view and the Day view for that time period.

Notice that Grok flagged unusual behavior at 8pm, 35 minutes before Amazon’s API
became completely unresponsive on the East Coast.

To understand this better, here’s a bit of information about this server.
“test02” is a test server running an instance of Grok.  We have servers in
multiple regions but this particular server sits in US-East-1 and was affected
by the incident.  Our servers make lots of outgoing API calls as is typical for
AWS applications.   The blue line shows CPU load on test02. As API calls slowed
down, retries and lags increased and the CPU load started became a bit wonky.
Eventually Cloudwatch became unresponsive and the data stopped coming in. The
really cool thing is that the alert happened 35 minutes before that point.
Luckily test02 is just a test server. We keep most of our production stuff in
US-West so this didn’t directly affect us. However I do know that plenty of US-
East users were affected and could have benefited greatly from an early warning.

It is useful to think about whether this could have been caught by some other
mechanism. First, any threshold based alerting system would NOT have caught the
anomaly. CPU load of 66% is not unusual at all for this server.  In fact there
are times when the CPU goes close to 100% when this server trains new models so
that’s out. A system looking at our service latencies would not have detected
anything either – our web server was actually perfectly responsive the entire
time. An anomaly detection scheme that relies on averages and standard
deviations would not have worked. The incident happened too fast, within just a
few 5-minute samples. A statistical technique that made a decision that fast
would lead to tons of false positives on noisy data (including normal usage when
CPU jumps to 100%!).  You can see in the hour view how fast Grok turned red –
Grok uses temporal sequences to detect unusual behavior. A more sophisticated
training mechanism that relies on classifying known patterns also wouldn’t have
worked. I have never seen this behavior before and would not have been able to
predict it.

Isn’t that the whole point though? We need a system that automatically detects
the unknown unknowns.

The above are actual snapshots from my smartphone for our server and this is an
actual incident (I admit I dramatized the first paragraph – let’s blame
marketing for that :-). For the record, below is a snapshot of the AWS status
page. Amazon states that no instances were affected and this is true – we can
attest that our machines kept running fine. On the other hand, any code that
relied on the AWS API was drastically affected by this incident.

In general AWS does an amazing job of keeping their infrastructure up and
running but occasional incidents do happen. These incidents are unpredictable
and they are unavoidable. It is comforting to know that Grok can give me a heads
up and some lead-time to investigate and figure out what to do. In a production
context I would have had plenty of time to spin up servers in another region and
redirect my traffic there.
