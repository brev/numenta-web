A few months ago, we mentioned that we're monitoring our AWS EC2 costs with
Grok. We developed a simple script to monitor our burnrate and ensure that when
our spend changed, we knew about it and could take action.  Since we posted
[Grok For Managing AWS Cost Anomalies](/blog/2014/08/29/grok-for-managing-aws-cost-anomalies/),
we've had requests for more details and for access to the script.

Today we're happy to announce that the script is available on Github at
[https://github.com/groksolutions/grok-burnrate](https://github.com/groksolutions/grok-burnrate).
You can run it as a standalone script or with Docker using the Dockerfile
there or by pulling from the public Docker registry.
