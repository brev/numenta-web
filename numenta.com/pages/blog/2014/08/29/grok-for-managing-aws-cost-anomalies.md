While the forefront issue in an engineer's mind might be that builds are
consistently running and production servers aren't experiencing unexpected
downtime, a business executive might have completely different concerns.  As an
experiment, I decided to address what I believed might be a primary concern of
IT managers: ensuring that AWS costs are managed to budget and costs are
minimized.  My approach was to feed cost data to Grok to identify any anomalies
in spending relative to the normal pattern of spend.

Using Grok's custom metrics, I sampled and fed AWS burnrate statistics into Grok
for regional burnrates as well as instance counts. Since AWS instances vary in
pricing, spinning up one EC2 I2-8xlarge instance could be just as much of a
problem as spinning up several T2-micro instances. Therefore, even though most
anomalies would likely be caught by both metrics, I wanted to be sure that
unexpected corner-case anomalies would be caught too.

In fact, at the beginning of my experiment, the burnrate monitor was able to
detect an anomaly in AWS's us-east-1 region. For ease-of-use, most of the
servers we use reside in the us-west-2 region, however all of our testing for
marketplace AMIs happens on us-east-1 servers. For that reason, early on August
4th, Grok detected an anomaly when our QA team began testing one of our
marketplace candidates. Since Grok had learned the regular pattern of nightly
AMI tests, when all of a sudden an instance was manually created, Grok quickly
notified me.

In this case because I knew the QA team was starting a new cycle of testing, I
was able to easily identify the cause of the anomaly.  Nevertheless, it was
useful that Grok identified the increased in instances and impact on costs. Had
I not expected the anomaly, I would have been able to quickly find the source of
the problem, whether it be a faulty testing script that forgets to delete
automatically created instances on failure, or an accidentally changed limit on
an auto-scaling group. In today’s dynamic and virtualized IT environments, it’s
great to have this peace of mind that jumps in costs outside of normal patterns
can be identified quickly. Not only can Grok tell an engineer that a server is
operating normally, but it can also report to a senior manager that their
company isn’t incurring unexpected costs.

In use cases with noisier data (such as burnrate for our us-west-2 region where
most of our instances are located), the burnrate monitor still excels at
detecting anomalous spending. Large, anomalous jumps in spending that could be
attributed to a larger than usual instance being spun up or accidentally setting
the minimum instance count of an auto-scaling group to 500 instead of 50 are
quickly recognized, enabling the proper team member to rapidly address the
issue. Rather than receiving an enormous (and unexpected) bill at the end of the
month, the cost and likelihood of a serious AWS mistake is substantially
mitigated.   During my experiment Grok was able to identify an anomaly due to an
error in the configuration of our auto-scaling group, causing it to grow
unnecessarily large.  Despite a more noisy usage pattern for this AWS region,
Grok was able to identify it.

Grok can also learn new behaviors. When we began to spin up several more costly
instances for testing, Grok first detected this behavior as anomalous, but as we
continued testing on the larger instances, Grok taught itself the new pattern
and stopped flagging the increased burnrates as anomalous. Especially with
Amazon continually announcing new instance sizes and costs, unexpected changes
to server burnrate are inevitable, and it’s necessarily important to be able to
learn the new burnrate patterns.
