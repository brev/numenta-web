#### Win a Kindle Paperwhite and a copy of *On Intelligence*

Did you ever think the Super Bowl could help you understand how your brain
works? Well, it can!

Numenta's core algorithm, the
[Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)](/technology-overview/),
relies on the properties of Sparse Distributed Representations. SDRs are the
fundamental way our brain represents information. The concepts behind SDR are
deep and thought provoking. We get a lot of questions around this and were
wondering how to explain it all in a fun simple way.

Enter the Sparse Football Pool. We came up with a simple Super Bowl quiz with
rules that closely mimic some operations in the CLA. We hope the quiz will be
fun and at the same time illustrate some deep principles behind the SDR.

The rules are extremely simple.   How exactly do they relate to SDRs? We'll
explain it all when we post the winner after the game, but for now here are two
tidbits: 1) computing overlap is a fundamental operation with SDRs, and 2) when
there are 30 questions and you choose 9, there are 14,307,150
[possible combinations](http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/discretemathematics/combinations.php)
of entries!

Also, in order to have more people participate, we're also offering a cool
prize. The winner will receive a digital copy of
*[On Intelligence](http://www.amazon.com/On-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B003J4VE5Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1359401193&sr=1-1&keywords=on+intelligence)*
as well as an Amazon
[Paperwhite Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OZNZG0/ref=s9_simh_gw_p349_d2_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=01F8XD1MTXSPHDJF52RD&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1389517282&pf_rd_i=507846).


#### The Three Rules:

1) Answer TRUE or FALSE for each answer.

2) You cannot have more than 9 TRUE answers. If you enter more than 9 TRUE
   answers, we will take the first 9 only.

3) To figure out the winner, we will compute the overlap score between the
   actual answers and your answer.  The person with the highest overlap score
   will win.


#### Computing Overlap Score

The overlap score simply gives you one point for every answer where you answered
TRUE and the correct answer was TRUE.   For example, if the answer to question 3
is True and you answered True, you get a point.    In all other cases you don't
get a point for question 3. Note that since you can only put down 9 TRUE's, the
maximum overlap score you can get is 9.

In case of ties, the earliest entry will win.  (Also, if you submit more than
one entry, only the last entry will count.)
