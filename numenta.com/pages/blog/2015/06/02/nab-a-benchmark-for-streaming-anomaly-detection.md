### Numenta Anomaly Benchmark

#### A Benchmark for Streaming Anomaly Detection

Data is in ever-increasing supply as sensors inhabit more and more of our world.
Examples abound from health data tracked by pacemakers and fitness wearables, to
temperature sensors in aircraft engines and mobile phones. These sensors provide
important information in real-time, streaming data. That is, time-series data,
where there is a natural temporal ordering in the successive measurements made
over a time interval.

Take a look at Figure 1 below, an example of time-series data from a sensor. The
plot shows scalar values over time for an unknown metric. Can you guess if the
metric is blood glucose level for a diabetes patient, stock volume for a Fortune
500 company, or something else? It’s difficult to tell, yet it’s apparent the
plot shows data anomalies, or deviations from the normal pattern.

> **Figure 1** – *An example data file from the NAB corpus; data from monitoring
  the temperature of an internal component of a large, expensive, industrial
  machine. The three blue regions represent anomaly windows, and the purple
  region is the detector’s probationary period. For details on these and more
  NAB components, please explore the
  [NAB wiki<sup>[1]</sup>](https://github.com/numenta/NAB/wiki).*

Looking at the entire plot, these anomalies are easily recognized after-the-fact
but identifying anomalies long after they occur isn’t acceptable. Yet many
anomaly detection methods run in batch mode, where the data is collected and
processed after the fact. Real-time data processing, on the other hand, calls
for continual input, process, and output of data. A real-world anomaly detector
should be required to process streaming data, learn continuously, and make
accurate detections as soon as possible.

At Numenta we’ve built a robust, real-time anomaly detector using
[Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)<sup>[2]</sup>](/assets/pdf/whitepapers/Numenta%20White%20Paper%20-%20Science%20of%20Anomaly%20Detection.pdf).
Our [Grok application](http://grokstream.com/) is great demo of the algorithm
in action on server metrics data<sup>[3]</sup>. Other real-time anomaly detectors are
out there, namely at
[Yahoo](http://labs.yahoo.com/news/announcing-a-benchmark-dataset-for-time-series-anomaly-detection/) and
[Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/introducing-practical-and-robust-anomaly-detection-in-a-time-series)
who both recently announced their activities in real-time anomaly
detection<sup>[4]\[5]</sup>. But how can one truly discern whether or not these
algorithms are up to the task of streaming anomaly detection? Sure HTM does
great on detecting anomalies in Amazon Web Services metrics with Grok, but what
about the other sensory domains?

Enter the **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)**, an open-source benchmark we’re
developing for the evaluation of real-time anomaly detection algorithms. The NAB
dataset contains streaming data samples, aiming to capture the difficulties of
real-time anomaly detection, across varying real-world domains. A detector run
on this dataset is subject to evaluation by the NAB scoring method. To score
well on NAB, anomaly detection algorithms should: run in unsupervised mode,
process real-time data, learn continuously, reliably detect anomalies, and
detect them as early as possible. Detailed descriptions of all NAB components
can be found in the NAB whitepaper posted in the
[wiki<sup>[1]</sup>](https://github.com/numenta/NAB/wiki). Figure 2 below shows
the Numenta detector on the sample data file of Figure 1, where the algorithm
accurately detected all three anomalies with no false positives.

> **Figure 2** – *NAB results for the Numenta detector on a data file
  representing machine component temperature readings. The detections resulted
  in all three true positives, and no false positive nor false negatives.*

We’re currently in a “beta” phase, working with a few select companies and
researchers to improve both the benchmark dataset and the scoring methods,
before submitting the benchmark for publication. Our aim during this phase is to
collaborate with businesses that need real-time anomaly detection and
researchers working on novel algorithms. Part of the value of the benchmark is a
data set consisting of diverse sensory data streams with real labeled anomalies.
As such we’re particularly interested in real-world data files with actual
anomalies to add to the dataset.

#### Call For Participation!

So far we’ve received some great feedback, but there’s still a ways to go. You
can help. Please [check out NAB<sup>[6]</sup>](https://github.com/numenta/NAB/)
for yourself. Do you have data to contribute? Great, we’d love to include it in
the benchmark, as long as your data meets the following criteria:

* Real-world, time-series data
* Labeled or known anomalies
* Minimum 1000 records per data file (more would be ideal)
* Data records must be
  * from a continuously streaming source
  * in chronological order
  * at roughly equal time intervals
* Scalar metric(s)

If you have data you might be able to contribute, are interested in the
benchmark, or have questions, please contact us at
[nab@numenta.org](mailto:nab@numenta.org).

No real-world anomaly detector is perfect, but which is best? Where do
algorithms make good and poor detections? NAB will be able to answer these
questions, providing the world of data analysis with a much-needed benchmark for
this very important class of algorithms.
