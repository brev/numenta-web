Around this time of year the US goes crazy over the Super Bowl. So be it, but
did you ever think the Super Bowl could help you understand how your brain
works? Well, it can!  Enter the Sparse Football Pool.

Numenta's theory of the cortex,
[Hierarchical Temporal Memory](/#technology),
relies on the properties of Sparse Distributed Representations. SDRs are the
fundamental way our brain represents information. The concepts behind SDR are
deep and thought provoking. We get a lot of questions around this and were
wondering how to explain it all in a fun simple way.

We came up with a simple Super Bowl quiz with rules that closely mimic some
operations in HTM. We hope the quiz will be fun and at the same time illustrate
some deep principles behind SDRs.

The rules are extremely simple. How exactly do they relate to SDRs? We'll
explain it all when we post the winner after the game, but for now here are two
tidbits: 1) computing overlap is a fundamental operation with SDRs, and 2) when
there are 30 questions and you choose 11, there are 54,627,300 possible
combinations of entries. The chance of getting all 11 correct is pretty small,
but given how improbably the Seahawks won their game anything is possible!

#### WIN AN AUTOGRAPHED COPY OF ON INTELLIGENCE

We're offering some cool prizes (US citizens 18 and over only). The top 5
winners will receive a Numenta T-shirt and an autographed hardcover of On
Intelligence. In addition the winner will receive a $100 gift certificate to
Amazon, iTunes, or Google Play (their choice).

#### THE THREE RULES

1. Answer TRUE or FALSE for each answer.
1. You cannot have more than 11 TRUE answers. If you enter more than 11 TRUE
    answers, we will take the first 11 only.
1. To figure out the winner, we will compute the overlap score between the
    actual answers and your answer. The person with the highest overlap score
    will win.

#### COMPUTING OVERLAP SCORE

The overlap score simply gives you one point for every answer where you answered
TRUE and the correct answer was TRUE. For example, if the answer to question 3
is True and you answered True, you get a point. In all other cases you don't get
a point for question 3. Note that since you can only put down 11 TRUE's, the
maximum overlap score you can get is 11.

In case of ties, the earlier entries will win. (Also, if you submit more than
one entry, only the last entry will count.) Full details are explained in the
[contest rules page](/legal/rules/sparse-football-pool-ii-2015.html).
