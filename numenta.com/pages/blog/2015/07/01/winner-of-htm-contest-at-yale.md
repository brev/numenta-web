### Winner of HTM Contest at Yale

This past month, Numenta sponsored a contest at Yale University, in
collaboration with the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute, for a prize to create an
application using our HTM technology.  We offered the winning team a $10,000
cash prize, along with a license structure that would enable them to create a
company to commercialize the application.   The contest was open to all Yale
students, faculty and alumni.  Why did we hold this contest at Yale?  We wanted
to test out the idea of an “entrepreneur contest” like this, and since I am on
the board of trustees at Yale and am familiar with the Yale Entrepreneurial
Institute, we decided this was a low friction way of conducting this experiment.
And we feel the experiment was a success!

We received multiple submissions for the prize with problems in such domains as
managing hospital data, understanding patents and fixing inefficient event
pricing.

The winning venture is called Good Day Bad Day (GDBD).  GDBD’s proposal was
created by Dr. Michael Choma, of the Yale Medical School, and Zhilong Cong, MS,
a graduate student at Yale in biomedical engineering.  Choma and Cong propose to
take streaming data from wearable devices, such as the Apple Watch, and use it
to improve management of chronic respiratory disease.  

We selected GDBD for several reasons.  First, the data meets fundamental
streaming requirements; there is a clear streaming data source -- a wearable
sensor -- and the data stream has sufficient velocity.  Second, it seems highly
likely that there will be temporal patterns that can be found by the HTM
algorithms.  Finally, Choma and Cong as a team have both the medical knowledge
as well as computer science skills to be able to create an application that
meets the needs of patients and physicians.

We congratulate GDBD on their win, and look forward to seeing how their
application evolves. Read the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute

We will consider sponsoring similar contests at other universities or
incubators.  We have no doubt that HTM can be applied to a huge range of
problems, so we find ourselves excited at the prospect of working with multiple
teams who have the expertise and the excitement to build HTM applications.  We
are very open to working with early stage start-ups, and have a start-up
friendly licensing structure. If you would like to connect with us to run a
contest or to talk about a start-up idea, please email us at
