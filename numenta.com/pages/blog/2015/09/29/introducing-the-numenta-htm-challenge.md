to engage our [community](http://numenta.org/#community) of dedicated and
passionate HTM enthusiasts. It's been a great time for lots of people involved.
We've grown together and created some really interesting things!

The one consistent complaint I've gotten from hackathon attendees is that there
just _**wasn't enough time**_ to complete their projects. In response to this
feedback and our desire to incubate more complete HTM projects, we have
completely changed the structure and format of our hackathons.  


## Introducting the Numenta HTM Challenge!

The [Numenta HTM Challenge](http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/) is an online
contest open for submissions **today** and running until November 14th.
Participants must come up with ideas for real-world applications of HTM
technology and submit them for approval before starting work. This ensures the
problem being solved is applicable to HTM, and that the data being analyzed is
adequate for HTM. Once a project has been approved, hackers have until
**November 6th** to work on it and submit a demo video for judging.


### Onsite Event Nov 14

**This Challenge can be completed _entirely_ online**, but we encourage you to
try to attend the
[**Onsite Event**](http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711586/) that
culminates the Challenge on November 14 in Redwood City, California. At this
Onsite Event, all demonstration videos will be viewed by a judging panel and a
live audience. Judges will get a chance to comment and ask questions to
submission authors (either live or over the phone). At the end of the event,
we'll announce the winners and cash prizes will be awarded!

#### Sessions

In addition to judging, there will also be at least two educational sessions by
Numenta team members **Subutai Ahmad** and **Jeff Hawkins**. They will be
talking about the history and evolution of HTM algorithms and some details about
new algorithm development, respectively.

##### Temporal Pooling (Jeff Hawkins)

> Temporal pooling is an important aspect of HTM theory. It refers to how
representations get more stable as sensory data moves from region to region
ascending the cortical hierarchy.  It plays an important role in inference,
feedback, and motor control. Our understanding of how temporal works has been
refined a couple of times since the original HTM white paper was published. In
this talk I will review the basic requirements of temporal pooling and introduce
a new model for temporal pooling, one that is more robust that previous
versions. I will also discuss how we think this new temporal pooling model is
implemented in neurons in the neocortex.

##### Temporal Memory of HTM: A Retrospective (Subutai Ahmad)

> Did you realize that the development of HTM algorithms at Numenta has been
going on for over 10 years? Subutai (who has seen it all) will step you through
the sequence of HTM developments, from our very first demos, algorithms and
products, to our current research on cortical algorithms. Come and see what we
have learned, and how our past informs our future.

#### [RSVP for the Onsite Event here](http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711586/)

**You don't have to participate in the Challenge to attend the Onsite Event!**
Maybe you just want to come see the latest presentations from Numenta or watch
the Challenge demonstration judging. That's great! We welcome you to mingle with
us HTM enthusiasts.


### [Community Meetup Nov 13](http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711563/)

And as long as you'll be in the area, there is a **Community Event** being
planned on the Friday before the Onsite Event. I hope you'll attend just to
**meet the rest of the HTM community**. This event is run _by_ the NuPIC
community, _for_ the NuPIC community. A schedule is in the works.

### Help us build the future of Machine Intelligence!

We believe that HTM is the future of machine intelligence. This is a great
chance for you to **get involved** and help us move this important technology
forward. I hope you'll consider being a part of this event in some way.
