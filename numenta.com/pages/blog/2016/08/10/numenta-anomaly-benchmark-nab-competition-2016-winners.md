The wait is over! We are proud to announce the winners of the 2016 Numenta
Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) Competition, held in conjunction with IEEE World
Congress on Computational Intelligence. The competition, which ran from February
through July this year, comes to a close after an exciting round of submissions.
This was the first ever publicly held contest for NAB.

When NAB was introduced last year, its mission was to address the need for a
standardized and publicly accessible benchmark for performance evaluation of
real-time anomaly detection. NAB’s open source repository includes over 50
labeled data streams from a wide range of real-world sources that capture the
traits crucial for testing anomaly detection in streaming data. In addition, NAB
contains a collection of popular anomaly detection algorithms and a unique
scoring scheme that enables effective comparison of different detection methods
against each other.

In an effort to take our mission of expanding NAB even further, we launched the
inaugural NAB Competition where participants can showcase their understanding of
real-time anomaly detection by contributing suitable datasets or algorithms, and
get a chance to win exciting cash prizes in return. Overall, the competition was
well received by the research community and attracted submissions not only from
the U.S but across the globe, including India and Russia. After careful
consideration, we decided on the following list of winners for the two
competition categories:  

### Dataset Category Winners

1. First prize: **Samya Bagchi**
1. Second prize: **BK Ramesh**

### Algorithms Category Winners

1. First prize: **Mikhail Smirnov**
1. Second prize: **Felix Andrews**
1. Third prize: **Vladislav Ishimtsev** & **Evgeny Burnaev**

All winning entries demonstrated creativity and a good sense of the problem
definition. In the dataset category, the entry bagging first prize provided
labeled anomalies for real patient blood pressure data, a very important domain
for streaming analytics. The second prize was awarded to a dataset retrieved
from a car engine motor system with annotated anomalies for voltage and current
metrics. Here are some interesting examples of anomalies from our winning
datasets, shown with red dots.

  The graph above shows a patient’s blood pressure readings every 5 milliseconds
  as the pressure drops steadily from diastole to systole. Every small
  oscillatory pattern represents a heartbeat. The first anomaly indicates
  pressure noise and the second anomaly indicates an irregular heartbeat, given
  by subtle temporal pattern changes.

  This graph shows current sensor data of a motor engine.  The first anomaly is
  an increase in maximum amplitude of a cycle, followed by another anomaly that
  shows a lag in starting the engine and the last anomaly resulting in engine
  failure.

In the algorithms category, winning submissions also achieved very impressive
scores on the benchmark. The entry securing first place worked with a novel
contextual encoding scheme, followed closely in second place by a modified
Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithm, and third place by a k-nearest neighbor
context based approach. All of these datasets and algorithms are valuable
contributions to NAB, helping accelerate our efforts to grow this benchmark and
improve its usefulness for all researchers. Winning entries are to be officially
included in an upcoming version release of NAB, and the algorithm scores will be
displayed on the NAB leaderboard.

We would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to all of our winners on
their achievement! We are also thankful to all participants for their
commendable effort and enthusiasm. The NAB competition hopes to return next
year, but until then we continue to welcome all relevant contributions at our
open-source code base https://github.com/numenta/NAB. For any questions or
comments on NAB, you can post at https://discourse.numenta.org/c/nupic/nab.
