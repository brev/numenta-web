Our termination of any user's access to the Numenta Offering may be effected
without notice and, on such termination, we may immediately deactivate or delete

liable to any Numenta user or other third party for any such termination.

You may terminate your use of the Numenta Offering by stopping its use without
notice to us.

using it at any time, and further charges will not accrue. We do not offer
refunds for any amounts paid.
