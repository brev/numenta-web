            Numenta believes that the coming era of machine intelligence
            will be based on biological principles. Our mission is to lead the
            emerging field of machine intelligence by understanding the
            neocortex and by building technology that reflects that
            understanding. To serve this mission, we strive both to create an
            active research community as well as to enable strong commercial
            opportunities.

            In our terminology, commercial use means using the technology or
            patents to create a product or service that is sold, licensed,
            hosted, or offered to customers or business partners as standalone
            functionality or as part of another product, whether for a fee or
            not. In addition, commercial use includes deploying the technology
            or patents internally to be used in any business process. For
            example, if you use our technology or patents internally to
            monitor performance of your IT servers, even if you don’t offer it
            to others, we view this as commercial use.

            Commercial partners are welcome to use our software under the

            this technology. We believe that a broad- based strategy is

                I operate a business. Why wouldn’t I use the free AGPL version
                for my product?
              </DefineTitle>
              <DefineItem>
                You are welcome to do so under the terms of that license. AGPL
                is a “copyleft” license. It requires that if you distribute or
                make available your software (either directly or through a
                SaaS model), you must also distribute the source code under
                the AGPL license. For some companies and some situations, that
                is an acceptable requirement. However, companies who want to
                keep the resulting code proprietary will prefer a commercial
                license.
              </DefineItem>
              <DefineTitle>
                If I do not intend to distribute or make available as a SaaS
                implementation any derivative software, then it seems to me
                that I can use the AGPL version internally without any
                additional license, even if it is for a commercial purpose.
                For example, I run a hedge fund and I figured out how to use
                NuPIC to advantage, but I don’t distribute the software or
                results, nor do I make it available to others. Is this
                correct?
              </DefineTitle>
              <DefineItem>
                Generally you may use the software and patents for internal
                use under the AGPL. Note, however, if you do not use our
                open-source software (and thus do not fall under the AGPL),
                you WOULD need a license for our IP. For example, say you do
                your own, very specific version of HTM for your hedge fund.
                Once you deploy that within your company for any productive
                purpose (as opposed to research), you would need an IP license
                from us because you are not under the AGPL.

                I’m a researcher who uses different machine learning
