described Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs). This isn’t the first time
someone has noticed that SDRs and Bloom filters use similar data structures, so
we’d like to describe the significant differences in their implementation and
capabilities.</p>
<p>Bloom filters are a fast and memory-efficient way to tell if you’ve seen
something before. They can tell you with 100% confidence that something is new,
though they can’t tell you for sure if an input has been seen before. (See this
<a href="http://billmill.org/bloomfilter-tutorial/">excellent visualization by Bill Mill</a>).</p>
<p>SDRs, core to Numenta’s Cortical Learning Algorithm, are the way we represent
and recognize inputs in a system like Grok:</p>
<p>&quot;The concept of SDRs comes from neuroscience, where sometimes it is called
&quot;sparse coding. SDRs are the language of brains in the same way that bytes and
&quot;words are the language of digital computers.  Sparse distributed
&quot;representations have several desirable properties including high capacity,
&quot;graceful degradation, tolerance to errors, and the ability to simultaneously
&quot;represent multiple values in one representation.</p>
<p>Both Bloom filters and SDRs store information in data structures called bit
arrays (or vectors), long strings where each character is either a one or a
zero. When encountering a new input, both create a representation of that input
by selecting a set of those bits to set as ones, or as we say “turn on.” Because
both choose a small subset of the bits to turn on, these representations can
both be considered “sparse.” Both, depending on the size of the array, have a
high capacity to store many inputs, and both can represent multiple inputs
simultaneously.</p>
<p>We need a bit more detail about Bloom filters to understand how they differ
fundamentally from SDRs.</p>
<p><img src="../images/bloom-thumb.jpg" alt="Bloom Filter" title="Bloom filter image"></p>
<p>(Click image to enlarge.)</p>
<p>To create a Bloom filter, you select one or more hashes. These are functions
that take an input and select which small set of bits to turn on in the bit
array.</p>
<p>Three key properties determine the efficient and predictable nature of Bloom
filters. Take, for example, a Bloom filter with three inputs: “Monday”,
“Thursday”, “Friday.” In a Bloom filter, the output bits representing these
inputs are uniformly distributed across the bit array.  The representation of
these outputs are independent of any similarities from the inputs.  And each
input always maps to the same output representations.</p>
<p>SDRs, on the other hand, assume the exact opposite!</p>
<p>Modeled after the brain, SDRs care about <em>semantic</em> relationships. We care that
inputs with similar meanings are stored in similar ways.  Because Thursday is
much closer to Friday than it is to Monday, SDR representations of the inputs
&quot;Thursday&quot; and “Friday” are similar!</p>
<p>Semantic relationships allow an SDR to answer not only the question, “Have you
ever seen this?” but also the question “Have you ever seen something <em>like</em>
this?”   Today we store inputs in a bit array that is 2000 bits long. Each new
input turns on 40 of those bits. If two inputs are very similar they may share a
good number of bits that get turned on (violating the independence assumption of
Bloom filters) and if they are very different they will almost certainly have a
very different set.</p>
<p>Going back to our example, let’s show a Bloom filter and an SDR the input
&quot;Saturday.&quot; If “Saturday” contains a single bit that is not on in the filter,
the Bloom filter confidently tells us it has never seen that before. An SDR, on
the other hand, would say, “Wait a minute, I’ve seen something close to that,
how about “Friday”?” An SDR is <em>robust</em> to some variations in input and is able
to <em>generalize</em> based on semantic closeness of inputs to previously seen values.
These properties are crucial in allowing Grok to correctly identify the same
object in different circumstances.</p>
<p>Similar inputs get blended, or, as we say, “pooled” together. When we retrieve
values from our data structure even a small overlap on the input will generate
some output. You could say our false positive rate is much higher than a Bloom
filter. However, overlapping inputs allow us to group similar things together.
Also because SDRs produce output when there are partial matches, they are
tolerant of noise. We can recognize two similar inputs even if they are
obscured, just like a human can recognize a loved-one’s face even through the
branches of a tree, or a familiar voice in a noisy room.</p>
<p>A false positive for a Bloom filter, in contrast, doesn’t mean anything. It’s
governed by chance, not semantic closeness. Bloom filters  throw away
similarities in inputs, whereas  SDRs take advantage of them.</p>
<p>SDRs also differ by having dynamic representations. They change over time. The
same input doesn’t always map to the same representation. When learning new
things, which representation you end up with in the SDR depends on what the
system has seen before. In addition if you haven’t seen an input for a while its
representation may have degraded somewhat. Because SDRs retain representations
strongly that are regularly reinforced and forget ones that are not, SDRs learn
and retain the most important inputs without getting “filled up” by noise. A
Bloom filter is static and will continue to get filled up for as long as it
continues to see new inputs. But then again, a Bloom filter that &quot;forgot&quot;
wouldn’t be very useful.</p>
<p>As you can see,  combining values and storing them in a bit array is a powerful
idea. You can end up with a memory-efficient test like the Bloom filter, or a
learning system that is general purpose, robust, adaptive, and high capacity
like SDRs.  There’s actually much more to SDRs. I’ve only described the use of
SDRs in a component of our system called the Spatial Pooler. There’s a whole
other set of representations in our Temporal Pooler that we don’t have time to
go into here.</p>

the brain, in <a href="http://youtu.be/A8sHMcCk0lU">another recent keynote</a> by Jeff
Hawkins.</p>
