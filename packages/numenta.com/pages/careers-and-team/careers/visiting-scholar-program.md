Numenta invites applications for its Visiting Scholar and Distinguished
Visiting Professor programs.   The goals of the program are to exchange
ideas, actively participate in Numenta's internal research discussions,
and start research collaborations.  The visitor will get a chance to
learn about Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and our research program
in-depth.  S/he will be able to continue their normal research during
the visit.

We encourage applications from outstanding young researchers
(e.g. late-stage PhD students, postdocs) as well as from established
professors and scientists in either computational or
experimental neuroscience.  The duration is flexible and customizable
based on specific situations, and can be anywhere from a few days to
several months.  While we expect the visitor to be salaried through
their home institution, funding support is available to cover travel
and/or lodging expenses.  

The environment at Numenta is highly collaborative, energetic, and open.
 Our research is fully transparent. Our source code, including daily
research code commits, is available via our open source Github project
NuPIC. We are located in the heart of Silicon Valley (Redwood City, CA),
close to Stanford University and San Francisco. 

### Research Areas

While there are many experimental neuroscience laboratories, Numenta is
unique in its focus on large-scale cortical theory and simulation.
 Numenta's current research focuses on developing a theory of how the
neocortex learns the structure of its world through movement
(sensorimotor learning). Here are some example specific areas of
interest:

-   Sequence learning and prediction in cortex

-   Sensorimotor inference and transformations

-   Common anatomical structure across sensory modalities, specifically
    the functional connectivity of layers I through VI in cortical
    columns.

-   Active dendrites, especially properties of apical dendrites, or
    plasticity mechanisms in active dendrites.

-   Functional properties of feedback connections in cortex

-   Organization of sensory systems, in particular what and where
    pathways

-   Cortico-thalamic connections

-   Neural representation and the cortical code, specifically sparse
    distributed representations

-   Representations of action and movement in motor cortex

### How To Apply

Interested applicants should send the following to [scholars@numenta.com](mailto:scholars@numenta.com):

-   Cover letter with a short writeup (1–3 paragraphs)
    briefly describing your field of interest, how it relates to HTM,
    and what you hope to get out of the visit.  Note that prior
    experience with HTM is not necessary, but you should have some idea
    of what aspects of HTM theory interest you.

-   Current curriculum vitae including list of published papers and 2
    references we can contact.

-   One or two papers that best represent your current research
    (unpublished work or presentations are ok, we will not distribute).
