            events. Other than confidential information relating to partner
            relationships, products or data, we work as much in the open as

            Given the uniqueness of our work and our early focus on temporal
            data, we have been issued over thirty U.S. and international
            patents. The list of issued U.S. patents can be {' '}

            In addition, we have international patents filed that are not

            foundational principles of machine intelligence.

            In our terminology, commercial use means using the technology or
            patents to create a product or service that is sold, licensed,
            hosted, or offered to customers or business partners as standalone
            functionality or as part of another product, whether for a fee or
            not. In addition, commercial use includes deploying the technology
            or patents internally to be used in any business process. For
            example, if you use our technology or patents internally to
            monitor performance of your IT servers, even if you don’t offer it
            to others, we view this as commercial use.

            Commercial partners are welcome to use our software under the

                I operate a business. Why wouldn’t I use the free AGPL version
                for my product?
              </DefineTitle>
              <DefineItem>
                You are welcome to do so under the terms of that license. AGPL
                is a “copyleft” license. It requires that if you distribute or
                make available your software (either directly or through a
                SaaS model), you must also distribute the source code under
                the AGPL license. For some companies and some situations, that
                is an acceptable requirement. However, companies who want to
                keep the resulting code proprietary will prefer a commercial
                license.
              </DefineItem>
              <DefineTitle>
                If I do not intend to distribute or make available as a SaaS
                implementation any derivative software, then it seems to me
                that I can use the AGPL version internally without any
                additional license, even if it is for a commercial purpose.
                For example, I run a hedge fund and I figured out how to use
                NuPIC to advantage, but I don’t distribute the software or
                results, nor do I make it available to others. Is this
                correct?
              </DefineTitle>
              <DefineItem>
                Generally you may use the software and patents for internal
                use under the AGPL. Note, however, if you do not use our
                open-source software (and thus do not fall under the AGPL),
                you WOULD need a license for our IP. For example, say you do
                your own, very specific version of HTM for your hedge fund.
                Once you deploy that within your company for any productive
                purpose (as opposed to research), you would need an IP license
                from us because you are not under the AGPL.

                I’m a researcher who uses different machine learning
                techniques. I’m trying to add capabilities that are similar to
                Numenta, i.e. using temporal data streams in a hierarchy, but
                I’m not using your software. What are my obligations relative

              </DefineTitle>
              <DefineItem>
                For researchers who are doing work that is covered by Numenta
                patents, we have promised to not assert our patents for any
                non-commercial use including publications, teaching, and
                experimentation. We do ask that you provide appropriate
                citations of our work. Make sure to visit our current repository
                of <TextLink to={links.in.papers}>research papers.</TextLink>
                {' '} If you are a corporate researcher who is applying this
                technology to commercial use, then you will need to evaluate the
                Numenta patent portfolio to see if our patents cover your work.
                If so, you should contact us to explore a patent license.
