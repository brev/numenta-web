### Summary

Come hear Jeff Hawkins speak about the machine intelligence work being done at
Numenta in NYC. This Meetup is an hour-long presentation by Jeff at 7PM,
followed by another hour of networking and socialization. Anyone is welcome to
attend, but you must RSVP. Anyone showing up at the door without an RSVP will be
turned away.

### Abstract

The neocortex is the only example we have of a cognitive system. I will argue
that understanding the principles of how the neocortex works and then building
machines that work on those principles is the only way to build intelligent
machines. I will describe the progress we are making in understanding how the
neocortex works and demonstrate how we are turning that knowledge into useful
technology and products.

### Biography

Jeff Hawkins is an engineer, serial entrepreneur, scientist, inventor, and
author. He was a founder of two mobile computing companies, Palm and Handspring,
and was the architect of many computing products such as the PalmPilot and Treo
smartphone. Throughout his life Jeff has also had a deep interest in
neuroscience and theories of the neocortex. In 2002 he founded the Redwood
Neuroscience Institute, a scientific institute focused on understanding how the
neocortex processes information. The institute is now located at U.C. Berkeley.
In 2004 he wrote the book On Intelligence, which describes progress on
understanding the neocortex. In 2005 he co-founded Numenta, a startup company
building a technology based on neocortical theory. It is his hope that Numenta
will play a catalytic role in the emerging field of machine intelligence. Jeff
Hawkins earned his B.S. in electrical engineering from Cornell University
in 1979. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2003.

### About Numenta

Numenta, Inc. was formed in 2005 to develop biologically-inspired machine
intelligence technology for both commercial and scientific use.

### What is NuPIC?

NuPIC, the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing, comprises a set of open
source learning algorithms that were first described in a white paper published
by Numenta in 2009. The learning algorithms faithfully capture how layers of
neurons in the neocortex learn. The white paper has been translated into seven
languages by volunteers and has generated considerable interest among developers
and research scientists.
