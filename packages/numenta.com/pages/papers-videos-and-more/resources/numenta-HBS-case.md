brief: "In spring of 2016, Harvard Business School Professor David B. Yoffie visited Numenta to begin the process of developing a case study for his International Business Administration classes.  The question at the heart of the case: could Numenta be successful in both creating fundamental technology and building a commercial business? While we ultimately decided to be a catalyst for machine intelligence, this offers a unique look back at the history of Numenta and how we’ve tackled a dual mission over the years."

In spring of 2016, Harvard Business School Professor David B. Yoffie visited Numenta to begin the 
process of developing a case study for his International Business Administration classes. The question at the heart 
of the case: could Numenta be successful in both creating fundamental technology and building a 
commercial business? While we ultimately decided to be a catalyst for machine intelligence, this 
offers a unique look back at the history of Numenta and how we’ve tackled a dual mission over the years.
