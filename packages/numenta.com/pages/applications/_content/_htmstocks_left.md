HTM for Stocks is an example application that detects anomalies in publicly
traded companies. It continuously models stock price, stock volume, and Twitter
volume for publicly traded companies and alerts you in real time when something
unusual is happening. You can experiment with this application by downloading
our sample application code below and connecting it to Twitter and metric
collectors.
