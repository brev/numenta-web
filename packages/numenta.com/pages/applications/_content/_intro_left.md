While Numenta does not build commercial applications, we have created example
HTM applications in several fields such as monitoring stock performance,
detecting unusual human behavior, and finding patterns in geospatial data.
Additionally, our partners have created commercial applications in the field of
monitoring IT infrastructure and understanding natural language. We are
confident that many additional applications will be created in the future.

HTM is well suited for applications that have the following characteristics:

* Data flowing through time: the data can be in the form of numbers, dates,
  text, or GPS points
* A data sampling rate from once per minute to once per hour, with the “sweet
  spot” being between once per minute and once every five minutes (faster
  velocity data can be aggregated or sampled as well)
* Data that has inherent structure, i.e. not entirely random
* Many models are required rather than one large model
* Focus of the application is prediction or anomaly detection

The following applications are examples that fit these characteristics:

* Highlighting anomalies in the behavior of moving objects, such as tracking a
  fleet’s movements on a truck by truck basis
* Understanding if human behavior is normal or abnormal on a securities trading
  floor
* Predicting energy usage for a utility on a customer by customer basis
* Predicting failure in a complex machine based on data from many sensors

In order to demonstrate these capabilities, we have created several tools and
example applications.
