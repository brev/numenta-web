Sitting at the intersection of neuroscience and computer science, we
encounter interest in our work from a variety of people. For the
scientific and academic community, we have a growing list of
peer-reviewed [papers](http://www.numenta.com/papers). The machine
learning and data science enthusiasts can dive into our open source code
and experiment with it firsthand. But what about those of us with no
exposure to neuroscience – those of us who are neither mathematicians
nor engineers, those of us who’ve never taken a computer science course?
Where do we go when we want to understand the fundamental concepts of
HTM Theory? We go to [HTM School](http://numenta.org/htm-school/).

HTM School was created nearly a year ago, by Numenta’s Open Source Flag
Bearer, [Matt
Taylor](https://discourse.numenta.org/users/rhyolight/activity), in an
attempt to make HTM Theory more accessible by breaking it down into
bite-sized, 15-20 minute episodes filled with stories, examples and
illustrations. The series is designed to be viewed in order, starting
with a high level overview in Episode zero. From there, Matt lays out
core components of the theory, one episode at a time: from how we
represent information to how we learn spatial patterns.

The series has attracted a nice following, with more than 35,000 total
views and a healthy amount of Q&A that takes place in the comments
section and on the [HTM
Forum](https://discourse.numenta.org/c/other-topics/youtube).

Recently, Matt published the 12^th^ episode in the series, “[Temporal
Memory, Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBzemKcUoOk),” marking
an educational milestone as the first episode to introduce the concept
of sequence memory. Readers of [On
Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533)
will remember this concept of how the brain remembers sequences of
events and makes predictions based on those memories. In “Temporal
Memory, Part 1,” Matt describes in detail how neurons remember sequences
within the context of previous inputs, and make predictions based on
this stimulus.

These are not easy concepts, to be sure. Understanding the neuroscience
within our theory of intelligence can be difficult, especially for
novices. Yet the implications of understanding how the brain learns and
implementing these concepts in software are significant. With HTM
School, Matt peels back the layers of complexity and uses computer
animated 3D visualizations and examples to make HTM theory accessible
for everyone.

If you haven’t been to HTM School yet, I recommend starting at Episode
0, and working your way up to the most recent episode. Matt’s intention
is to continue to produce more videos, so now’s the perfect time to get
caught up. If you have a question about the content, sound off in the
comments of the videos or post your questions on the [HTM
Forum](https://discourse.numenta.org/c/other-topics/youtube), where Matt
has a dedicated section for discussion associated with these videos.

**Jeff and Subutai to deliver opening keynote at Cornell Silicon Valley
on March 7 in San Francisco **

In between your HTM School tutorials, for those of you in the San
Francisco area, you can catch Jeff Hawkins and Subutai Ahmad deliver the
opening keynote at [Cornell Silicon
Valley](http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/csv/csv17/schedule.cfm) on March 7
at 1pm: “Reverse-engineering the brain for intelligent machines.” Jeff
and Subutai will have a conversation about the work we do at Numenta and
the progress we’ve made. Don’t miss this rare opportunity to see them
onstage together.
