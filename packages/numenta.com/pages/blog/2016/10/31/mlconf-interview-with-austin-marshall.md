For the second year in a row, Numenta is sponsoring
[MLconf San Francisco](http://mlconf.com/events/san-francisco-ca/), a Machine
Learning conference that began in 2012 as a partnership with Carnegie Mellon
University.  Now its own entity, MLconf targets the San Francisco data science
community, gathering people from industry, research and academia to discuss
various machine learning methodologies and advances.

MLconf Technical Chair Nick Vasiloglou recently interviewed one of our
engineers, Austin Marshall, about HTM and our approach in this space.  In their
conversation, Nick asks Austin about a variety of topics - from AI to
reinforcement learning to how HTM differs from deep learning.
