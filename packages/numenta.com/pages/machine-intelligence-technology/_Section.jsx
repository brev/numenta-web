          we have created HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory), a theoretical
          framework for both biological and machine intelligence. Our HTM
          technology is not just biologically inspired. It’s biologically
          constrained. When applied to computers, HTM is well suited for
          prediction, anomaly detection, classification and ultimately
          sensorimotor applications. We believe this technology will be the
          foundation for the next wave of computing.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          At the core of HTM are learning algorithms that can store, learn,
          infer and recall high-order sequences. Unlike most other machine
          learning methods, HTM learns time-based patterns in unlabeled data on
          a continuous basis. HTM is robust to noise, and high capacity, meaning
          that it can learn multiple patterns simultaneously.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          HTM works best with data that meets the following characteristics:
