Based on a wealth of [neuroscience evidence][neuro], we have created HTM
(Hierarchical Temporal Memory), a theoretical framework for both biological and
machine intelligence. Our HTM technology is not just biologically inspired. It’s
biologically constrained. When applied to computers, HTM is well suited for
prediction, anomaly detection, classification and ultimately sensorimotor
applications. We believe this technology will be the foundation for the next
wave of computing.

At the core of HTM are learning algorithms that can store, learn, infer and
recall high-order sequences. Unlike most other machine learning methods, HTM
learns time-based patterns in unlabeled data on a continuous basis. HTM is
robust to noise, and high capacity, meaning that it can learn multiple patterns
simultaneously.

HTM works best with data that meets the following characteristics:

* Streaming data rather than batch data files
* Data with time-based patterns
* Many individual data sources where hand crafting separate models is
  impractical
* Subtle patterns that can’t always be seen by humans
* Data for which simple techniques such as thresholds yield substantial false
  positives and false negatives

Our technology has been [tested and implemented in software][apps], all of which
is developed with best practices and suitable for deploying in commercial
applications.
