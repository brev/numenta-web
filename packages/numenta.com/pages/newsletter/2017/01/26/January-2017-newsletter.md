### Numenta Newsletter &mdash; January 26, 2017

As we kick off a new year here at Numenta, we find ourselves as busy as
ever and excited for what lies ahead.  A year ago at this time, we were
focused on publishing our first peer-reviewed paper.  I’m pleased to
share that as I write this newsletter, we have two peer-reviewed papers
that are receiving an impressive number of views. Our first, “[Why
Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in
Neocortex,](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncir.2016.00023/full)”
is the most viewed paper in the history of the journal in which it’s
published: *Frontiers in Neural Circuit*s.  The second, “[Continuous
Online Sequence Learning with an Unsupervised Neural Network
Model](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/NECO_a_00893#.WIWQztUrKpp),”
was only published two months ago and is already the 2nd most viewed
paper in its journal, *Neural Computation*, over the past twelve
months.  We’re happy to see these articles reaching a wide audience, and
we are already working on adding to our portfolio. You can find these,
along with our entire collection, on our website at
[numenta.com/papers](http://www.numenta.com/papers).

For those of you that look for us at different events, we have several
scheduled over the next couple months.  We’ll be at [Smart
Data](http://smartdata2017.dataversity.net/sessionPop.cfm?confid=110&proposalid=9381)
in Redwood City from Jan 30-Feb 1, where Scott Purdy will deliver a talk
on “How to Model Streaming Data That You Know Nothing About.”  Jeff and
Subutai will be at several events as well.  They’ll be joined by some of
our research engineers at [Cosyne](http://www.cosyne.org/) the last week
of February.  The team will present a poster titled, “Robust object
learning with cross-cortical column connections,” and Subutai will lead
a workshop based on our peer-reviewed neuron paper.  Jeff will also be
presenting at the [5th Neuro Inspired Computational Elements Workshop
(NICE 2017)](https://www.src.org/calendar/e006125/) in early March
before joining Subutai to deliver an opening keynote for [Cornell
Silicon Valley](http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/csv/csv17/schedule.cfm) on
March 7.  To view all of our upcoming events, and presentations from
past events, visit [numenta.com/events](http://www.numenta.com/events).

In other news, we recently started a [Visiting Scholar
Program](http://numenta.com/careers-and-team/careers/visiting-scholar-program/),
where scientists can apply to spend some time with us for anywhere from
a few days to a few months.  During their visit, they can join all of
our research meetings while continuing to work on their normal
research.  This gives them a chance to learn HTM more deeply and us a
chance to explore possible research partnerships. We strive to maintain
an open, collaborative environment, and this program supports that.  For
an inside look at how the program works, read this [blog
post](http://numenta.com/blog/2017/01/17/visiting-scholar-program/) from
our first visiting scholar, Mirko Klukas, Ph.D.

Lastly, we have an opening in marketing that is a great opportunity for
someone who is ready to learn and eager to help us share our story. If
you or someone you know are interested in this position, you can [apply
