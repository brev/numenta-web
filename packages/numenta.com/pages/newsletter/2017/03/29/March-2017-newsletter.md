### Numenta Newsletter &mdash; March 29, 2017

Last month, our Research team attended [Cosyne
2017](http://www.cosyne.org/c/index.php?title=Cosyne_17) (Computational
and Systems Neuroscience), to present important new work on our current
area of focus within HTM Theory: sensorimotor integration. This research
looks at how the neocortex learns through movement. The team delivered a
poster titled “[3D Object Learning with Cortical
Columns](http://numenta.com/assets/pdf/posters/CosynePoster_2017.pdf),”
which outlined how cortical columns learn 3D sensorimotor models of the
world. We believe this work is a significant advance in our evolving
theory of how the brain works and expect to share more details as it
continues to develop. In the meantime, if you’re interested in learning
more about it, our Open Source Community Manager, Matt Taylor, recently sat
down with Jeff to discuss the latest research in detail,
along with a number of HTM topics. You can watch the entire conversation
in the video series “[HTM Chat with Jeff
Hawkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNc73-tHHgY&list=PL3yXMgtrZmDrlePl0jUIZWKwQwUgOfxA-)”
and join the discussion on the [HTM
Forum](file:///C:\Users\cmaver\Documents\newsletters\2017\discourse.numenta.org).

Jeff and Subutai delivered a joint keynote at [Cornell Silicon Valley
2017](https://www.alumni.cornell.edu/csv/csv17/) on March 7 titled “Reverse
Engineering the Brain for Intelligent Machines.” During their 20 minute
talk, they provided an overview of Numenta and covered topics including
how our biological AI approach differs from others, the current state of
neuroscience research, and what we’ve learned so far. Though the event
was for Cornell alumni, the university was kind enough to let us share
this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfxG5aSTrHA&t=28s) of the
keynote.

For those of you familiar with
[BAMI](http://numenta.com/biological-and-machine-intelligence/), our
living book on biological and machine intelligence, we recently added
two new chapters: [Spatial
Pooling](http://numenta.com/spatial-pooling-algorithm/) and [Temporal
Memory](http://numenta.com/temporal-memory-algorithm/). These chapters
offer a collection of resources–from videos to algorithm details and
pseudocode–that help explain each concept. Make sure to follow our
[NumentaBAMI Twitter](https://twitter.com/numentabami) account if you’d
like to be notified about future updates.

In [partner](http://numenta.com/partners/) news, Francisco Webber,
Co-founder of [Cortical.io](http://www.cortical.io), was featured on the
O'Reilly Data Show podcast this month. In this episode,
“[Natural language analysis using Hierarchical Temporal
Memory,”](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/natural-language-analysis-using-hierarchical-temporal-memory)
Francisco talked about how he is applying HTM to natural language and
big text data problems.

Our partner [Grok](http://www.grokstream.com) launched the [Applied
Machine Learning Exchange](http://www.aml.exchange) designed to provide
insights on leveraging machine learning to solve real, human problems.
One of the key components is a conversation series, which kicked off
March 1 with a discussion on “Machine Learning for the Entire Business
Stack” and featured our Director of Engineering, Scott Purdy. You can
watch the replay [here](http://www.aml.exchange/webinar1/).
