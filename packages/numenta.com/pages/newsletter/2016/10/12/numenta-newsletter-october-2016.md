### Numenta Newsletter &mdash; October 12, 2016

One of my favorite parts of working at Numenta is fielding the inquiries that
come in from people all over the world. As the buzz in the AI landscape
continues to increase, what has become clear through my interactions with people
that contact us is that they are eager to learn more – more about our
technology, more about our approach. They want to understand how we are
reverse-engineering the neocortex and applying what we learn to create machine
intelligence technology.

That’s why we are continuing to work on our living book, called BAMI, which
stands for [Biological and Machine Intelligence][1].  This book, which documents
our detailed computational theory of the neocortex and its applications for
machine intelligence, is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of our
theory, Hierarchical Temporal Memory.  For anyone that wants to learn about HTM,
BAMI is a must-read.  We are making great progress in our research and will
continue to update BAMI as we do.  Follow our BAMI twitter account
[@NumentaBAMI][2] to be alerted when we make an addition or revision.

In other news, I’m pleased to share some updates from our partners.

[Cortical.io][3] has been making headlines with talks at events around the
globe. Recently, Francisco Webber, co-founder and general manager, presented to
a packed crowd at the first ever O’Reilly AI conference, co-located with Strata
in New York City.  In his talk, "[AI is not a matter of strength but of
intelligence][4]", Francisco explained why many Natural Language Processing
projects fail with some machine learning techniques.  He went on to show how to
overcome those issues with semantic folding, their breakthrough technology that
incorporates Numenta’s research on how the brain processes information.

Francisco will also be speaking next month at [Data Natives in Berlin][5], where
Cortical.io will also have a booth, October 26-28.  He will close out the year
as a panelist at [AI Europe][6], where he’ll discuss aspects of being a startup
in the ever-changing field of AI.

Meanwhile, [Grok][7] has been busy as well. They were recently awarded with an
honorable mention at [Tech.Co’s 4th annual Startup of the Year competition][8].
Grok was one of 50 startups from around the world selected from a thousand to
compete in San Jose from September 20-22.  Grok was the only startup chosen in
the Cloud Services category.  

I recently caught up with Grok Head of Product, [Tarun Gangwani][9], to get the
latest news about the company, including its recent expansion, plans for the
platform and where they’re headed next.  To see my conversation with him,
[click here][10].

Lastly, we have a new blog post on our site that gives a behind the scenes look
at how we brought HTM Studio, a tool that allows anyone to experiment with our
technology on their own data, to life.  You can read project manager and
engineer Marion Le Borgne’s firsthand account [here][11].  If you’re attending
[MLConf][12] on November 11 in San Francisco, stop by our table to get a live
demo of HTM Studio.
