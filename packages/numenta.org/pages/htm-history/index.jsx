              The Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience was established in
              July 2005, when the Redwood Neuroscience Institute (RNI) was
              gifted to UC Berkeley. RNI was a private, non-profit research

              The goal of RNI
              was to develop a theoretical framework for the thalamo-cortical
              system. Its staff consisted of principal investigators, postdocs,
              and students who worked closely together and shared this common
              vision. It fostered a vibrant intellectual environment that lead
              to the development of many new ideas.

              Numenta was founded in 2005 by Jeff Hawkins, Dileep George and
              Donna Dubinsky. Hawkins is the author (with Sandra Blakeslee) of
              On Intelligence, which describes the theory of the neocortex used
              as the basis for Numenta's technology. Numenta is the third
              collaborative venture for Hawkins and Dubinsky who were
              co-founders of Palm Computing and Handspring.

              Numenta introduced its first Research Release of the Numenta
              Platform for Intelligent Computing (NuPIC), including
              first-generation learning algorithms, to the developer community
              in March 2007. In June 2009, the company released version 1.7 of
              NuPIC along with a Vision Toolkit that allows non-programmers to
              experiment with creating, training and doing inference on HTM
              networks with image classification.

              Numenta's first generation of HTM algorithms was internally called
              "Zeta 1" and was not open source. This product was focused on
              vision, and it contained hierarchy and invariance. It did not have
              Sparse Distributed Representations, sequence memory, or
              predictions. It primarily did image classification and contained
              an "image toolkit". The hierarchy worked quite well, and we came
              away from this development with a strong understanding of what
              hierarchy was, how it worked, and what was required for it to
              work. Commercial products were developed with this software by a
              company called Vitamin D, which could call out human figures in
              live video feeds and differentiate them from other moving objects.
              This is still in production software today.

            <Paragraph>
              The only thing on Jeff's list of requirements fully achieved by
              Zeta 1 was "hierarchy and invariance". Numenta pulled away to
              focus on the elements of intelligence that Zeta 1 did not address.
              Zeta 1 was not nearly as biologically plausible as our current
              algorithms, and it became clear that we were moving down the wrong
              path if we wanted to meet all the requirements in Jeff's list.

              in June 2013. It does not contain hierarchy/invariance, but it was
              built with a much stricter adherence to biological constructs and
              is much closer to the neuroscience than Zeta 1. This includes the
              elements of "sequences and prediction" and "continuous learning".
              Our plan was to focus on developing one region of the neocortex
              (without hierarchy) in a way that was as close to the biology as
              possible, and always ensuring that hierarchy could be added when
              the time was right.

              to be our 3rd generation of algorithms. While the switch from Zeta
              1 to the current NuPIC codebase was a huge shift and basically a
              reconstruction of all parts of HTM/CLA, the 3rd generation is
