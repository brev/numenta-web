## 11. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURE

We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate
accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the
U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“**DMCA**”).

NOTICE OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT:

If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes
copyright infringement, please send the following information to our
designated copyright agent named below (“**Designated Agent**”) either
by mail or e-mail:

1.  Your name, physical address, telephone number and e-mail address;

2.  identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been
    infringed;

3.  A description of the material that is claimed to be infringing
    reasonably sufficient enough to permit us to locate the claimed
    infringing material;

4.  A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the
    disputed use is not authorized by you, the copyright owner, its
    agent, or the law;

5.  A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above
    information is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or have
    been authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; and

6.  A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act
    on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest.

You acknowledge and agree that upon receipt and notice of a claim of
infringement, we may immediately remove the identified materials from
the Numenta Websites without liability, and the claims of the
complaining party and the party that originally posted the materials
will be referred to the United States Copyright Office for adjudication
as provided in the DMCA.

COUNTER-NOTICE BY ACCUSED USER:

If we have taken down your materials due to suspicion of copyright
infringement, you may dispute the alleged infringement by sending the
following information to our Designated Agent either by mail or e-mail
(“**Counter Notice**”):

1.  Your physical or electronic signature;

2.  Identification of the content that has been removed or to which
    access has been disabled and the location at which the content
    appeared before it was removed or disabled;

3.  A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the
    content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
    misidentification of the content; and

4.  Your name, physical address, telephone number and e-mail address and
    a statement that (a) you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal
    Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or
    if your address is outside of the United States, to the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California
    and (b) you will accept service of process from the person who
    provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a Counter Notice is received by the Designated Agent, we may forward
a copy of the Counter Notice to the original complaining party. The
claimant must then notify us within ten (10) days that (s)he has filed
an action seeking a court order against you to restrain you from
engaging in infringing activity relating to the content that was removed
or disabled. If we receive such notification, we will not be able to
restore your material. If we do not receive such notification, we may,
at our sole discretion, reinstate the material.

Please note that when we forward the Counter Notice, it includes your
personal notification. By submitting a Counter Notice, you consent to
having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the
Counter Notice to any party other than the original claimant.

DESIGNATED COPYRIGHT AGENT:

Please send all notices under the above copyright infringement policies
to our Designated Agent at <copyright@numenta.com> or at:

**Numenta\
Attn: Teri Fry\
791 Middlefield Rd.\
Redwood City, CA 94063**

Please do not send notices or inquiries about anything other than
alleged copyright infringement to our Designated Agent.

REPEAT INFRINGERS:

Your Account will be terminated if, in our discretion, you are
determined to be a repeat infringer. Repeat infringers are users who
have been the subject of more than one valid takedown request that has
not been successfully rebutted.

## 12. TERMINATION

We may terminate your access to all or any part of the Numenta Websites
at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective
immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all
information associated with your Account. If you violate any terms of
these Terms, including the Additional Terms, your permission to use the
Numenta Websites automatically terminates. All provisions of these
Terms, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive
termination, including without limitation, licenses of User Content,
ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
liability.

## 13. ASSIGNMENT

These Terms are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or
sublicensable by you without our prior written consent. We may assign,
transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations under these
Terms, including, without limitation, in connection with a merger,
acquisition, a sale of assets or by operation of law, without your
consent. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall
be null and void.

## 14. FORCE MAJEURE

Under no circumstances will Numenta be liable for any failure to perform
our obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, where such failure
results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including without
limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or
degradation.

## 15. NO WAIVER

Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms shall not constitute a
waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these
Terms. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean
that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of
compliance with these Terms to be binding, we must provide you with
written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized
representatives.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
NUMENTA OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING FOR THE INDIRECT LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE OR DATA) ARISING OUT

WHATEVER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY BROUGHT (INCLUDING UNDER
ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORT THEORY OF LIABILITY) EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

## 17. INDEMNIFICATION

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Numenta and its Affiliates from all
liabilities, claim and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees,

Account or identity on the Numenta Websites, of any intellectual
property or other right of any person or entity. We reserve the right to
assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject
to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate
with us in asserting any available defenses.

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California, including its conflicts of law rules,
and the United States of America. Without waiving the foregoing
arbitration provision, you agree that any dispute arising from or
relating to the subject matter of these Terms or your use of the Numenta
Websites shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
the state and federal courts of San Francisco County, California, except
where the jurisdiction and venue are mandated by applicable law. We
retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court
of competent jurisdiction arising out of or in connection with or in
relation to these Terms and your use of the Numenta Websites.

## 19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND SEVERABILITY

These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Numenta with
respect to the Numenta Websites, including use of the Numenta Websites,
and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals
(whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Numenta with
respect to the Numenta Websites. If any provisions of these Terms found
to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or
eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will
otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
