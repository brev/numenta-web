Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a biologically-constrained theory of
intelligence originally described in the book [On Intelligence][book].
HTM is not a Deep Learning or Machine Learning technology. It is a machine
intelligence framework strictly based on neuroscience and the physiology and
interaction of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex of the mammalian brain.

If you’re interested in learning more about HTM, visit our
educational series [HTM School][school] or browse through the topics
on [HTM Forum][forum]. You can also find a collection of research papers at
http://numenta.com/papers/ and a living book authored by Numenta researchers and
engineers that documents HTM
called [Biological and Machine Intelligence (BAMI)][bami].
