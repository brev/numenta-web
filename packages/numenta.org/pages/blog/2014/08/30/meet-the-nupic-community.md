You might not have heard about it, but the NuPIC mailing lists had to be
[migrated to a private server recently](http://lists.numenta.org/pipermail/nupic_lists.numenta.org/2014-August/009295.html),
so we had a short outage. Once the lists had been moved, I wanted to reengage
our community members after a couple day of limited messages, so I asked
everyone to introduce themselves, and we're getting some really fascinating
responses. The NuPIC community is quite diverse and passionate! You might enjoy
reading through some of the responses on each of our lists (look for the topics
entitled "We're back in business, introduce yourself!".

Here are some interesting excerpts:

> *"Currently, I am working with a student in collaboration with an expert MD on
  using NuPIC for analyzing medical vital signs for diagnosis of medical
  conditions and early warnings on abnormal incidents. We are at the first
  stages of this work. I will let you know if we get some promising results."*
  —**Spyros Vassilaras, PhD**

> *"Thx Numenta for creating this awesome community."*
  —**Alex GuangTou**

> *"For a while long ago i seriously thought i would be an opera singer, but
  despite great bass notes i couldn't hit a high G, so that career ended
  abruptly. And as of yesterday i appear to be a cancer survivor, so yay!"*
  —**Matthew Lohbihler**

> *"NUPIC should be renamed to EPIC:-)"*
  —**Chirag Mirani**

> *"I am new to opensource but it is surprising how cool and encouraging the
  NuPIC community is and it has set a very high standard for opensource
  communities in my mind. Thanks NuPIC."*
  —**Anubhav Chaturvedi**

> *"I'm really excited about what Numenta is doing and will be doing a small
  presentation about the CLA and NuPIC in my college soon!"*
  —**Kevin Martin Jose**

> *"I regard following the progress of Numenta as the most interesting news
  available. I wish to someday implement a version of Nupic in a
  consumer product."*
  —**Dave Petrillo**

> *"I discovered Jeff from his Triangulation interview back in April and have
  been hooked ever since."*
  —**Ryan Belcher**

> *"I'd say the only thing I don't really understand about HTM is why there is
  not even more widespread interest for it from the AI community."*
  —**Angela Bovo**

> *"I was one of the season-of-nupicers this year which was pretty interesting.
  I made an experimental visualisation library for NuPIC. Which i hope to
  properly release soon."*
  —**Ruaridh O'Donnell**

> *"I have developed a good intuition for the characteristics of our brain and
  central nervous system as models for IT simulations and the CLA, HTM, SDR
  concepts together are very brilliant and worth their weight in gold. As it
  turns, I also apply some data science to some of the data in our systems and I
  believe that GROK may one day be a good solution for some future applications.
  For now, this is a hobby I follow with enthusiasm."*
  —**Joe Perez**

> *"Then I stumbled on one of Jeff's keynotes online and it blew my mind. Now
  I'm working to understand/develop/apply HTM, and build the future with you
  all..."*
  —**Felix Andrews**

> *"By day I lead the Cloud Foundry team at HP, but ever since I saw Jeff speak
  at OSCON last year, I've been digging neocortical simulations. I'm
  particularly interested in the realm of procedurally generated content in
  games and other media, and I hope to do a session about Machines the Tell
  Stories at SXSW Interactive next year."*
  —**Jeff Kramer**

And lastly, you gotta read this wonderful interaction between a high school
student and an elderly Chinese PhD:

> *Hi, Anthony Liu:*
> *☺,  I am this too old, and you are so young!*
> *I had lived at bay area for some years, that is an area creating stories,
> always.*

**I love this stuff!** NuPIC bringing people together from all walks of life
FOR SCIENCE!!!! Big thanks to the [NuPIC community](/community/) for being
such good people.
