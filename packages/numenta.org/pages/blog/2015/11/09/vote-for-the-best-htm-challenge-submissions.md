Were you ***devastated*** that you weren't chosen for the prestigious
[HTM Challenge Judging Panel](http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/#judges)? Don't
worry, ***your opinion still matters!*** There are two ways you can help decide
who shines in the HTM Challenge. Please read below and help us out by voting for
your favorite submissions.

## [People's Choice](http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/submissions/)

There are 12 submissions at <http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/submissions/> ready
for voting. To vote, simply click on a submission, watch the demo video, and --
if you like it -- click the big green "Vote for this project!" button at the top
right of the page. You may vote for as many submissions as you like.

## [Innovation](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HTMInnovation)

Two submissions are in a
[special category for innovation](http://htmchallenge.devpost.com/updates/4305-new-prize-for-innovation).
This may be particularly relevant to our community, because this stuff has an
impact on HTM research and development! To vote for one of the two innovation
prizes, [**please go to this survey**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HTMInnovation)
(after watching the demo videos below) and vote:

- [Column Swarm Reinforcement Learning (CSRL)](http://devpost.com/software/column-swarm-reinforcement-learning)
- [ComportexViz, but for NuPIC](http://devpost.com/software/comportexviz-but-for-nupic)

## Voice Your Opinion

Go forth and vote for your favorite submissions! The prizes for the categories
above will be awarded at this Saturday's
[HTM Challenge Onsite Event](http://www.meetup.com/numenta/events/224711586/)
(which you should RSVP for if you are coming).

***Good luck to all the submissions!***
